It is located on  Pentonville Road , around 250 metres (0.2\u00a0mi) east of  King's Cross mainline station . It was included in the  London station group  from the group's inception in 1983, and remained so until the station closed in 2007. By then, it was on the  Thameslink route  between  Farringdon  and  Kentish Town  stations.\n The station opened in 1863 as  King's Cross Metropolitan . It was one of the initial seven stations on the  Metropolitan Railway , London's first underground line, which ran between  Paddington  and  Farringdon . The Metropolitan had been planning for the station since 1851, when King's Cross mainline station was constructed, to provide a connection between the  Great Western Railway  at Paddington and the  Great Northern Railway  (GNR) out of King's Cross. Within a year of opening a pair of tunnels was added, which surfaced on the GNR just north of King's Cross and provided a direct rail connection between the two lines. In 1866 the line was extended east to  Moorgate  and south through  Snow Hill tunnel  to join the  London, Chatham and Dover Railway  at  Ludgate Hill , and in 1868 a second pair of tracks known as the  City Widened Lines  was opened along with a tunnel connection to the  Midland Railway  near  St Pancras station . The route through the station was very busy throughout the remainder of the century, carrying trains from five companies. In 1892 the station was linked to the concourse of King's Cross mainline station by a foot tunnel.\n The opening of the Piccadilly and Northern underground lines, as well as the growth of trams on the surface streets, led to a sharp reduction of services on the City Widened Lines in the early twentieth century. The Metropolitan line remained popular, however, following electrification of its tracks in 1905\u201306. Passenger service was reduced to peak hours only during the  First World War , with no service through the Snow Hill tunnel, as the lines were used heavily for freight and troop movements. The line and station were closed for five months during the  Second World War , following damage in  The Blitz . Only the City Widened Lines platforms remained in use when the station reopened in 1941: the Metropolitan line station was moved to a new pair of platforms which had been built at  King's Cross St Pancras tube station , providing a shorter connection to the Piccadilly and Northern lines. Trains from the  East Coast main line  and  Midland main line  continued to stop at King's Cross Metropolitan. In the 1980s the City Widened Lines were electrified and the Snow Hill tunnel reopened to passenger traffic as part of the  Thameslink  programme. The station was renamed, first to  King's Cross Midland City  and then to its final name, King's Cross Thameslink. Service on the line grew and new destinations were added, and by the 2000s the station could no longer handle the passenger numbers. A new pair of platforms were built at St Pancras, and King's Cross Thameslink closed in 2007.\n Contents 1 Naming 2 Location and layout 3 History 3.1 Early history 3.2 King's Cross Metropolitan 3.3 Arrival of the deep tube and relocation of Metropolitan platforms 3.4 Thameslink programme 3.5 Closure and relocation 4 Services 5 Notes 6 References 7 External links Naming edit The station was officially known as King's Cross Metropolitan when it opened by the  Metropolitan Railway  in 1863, [1]  although on timetables and maps it was often just called King's Cross or King's Cross (Met.). [2]  The Metropolitan line part of the station was renamed to King's Cross & St Pancras in 1925 and then to King's Cross St Pancras in 1933, [3]  when the Metropolitan Railway was merged with the  Underground Electric Railways Company of London  to form the  London Passenger Transport Board  (LPTB). [4]  The station was then part of the  King's Cross St Pancras tube station  complex. The City Widened Lines platforms continued to be signed as King's Cross through to the 1970s. [5]  When the station reopened in 1983, following electrification, it was known as King's Cross Midland City and acquired its final name, King's Cross Thameslink, in 1988. [1] Location and layout edit King's Cross Thameslink is located in a cutting around 250 metres (0.2\u00a0mi) east of  King's Cross mainline station [6] [1]  The station's main entrance was on the north side of the station at the western end of  Pentonville Road [7]  part of the  London Inner Ring Road . This replaced an earlier entrance located south of the tracks on  Gray's Inn Road [1]  The Thameslink platforms were linked directly by stairs and a tunnel to the  Victoria  and  Piccadilly line  platforms at King's Cross St Pancras, and via both sets of platforms to the  Circle Hammersmith & City Metropolitan  and  Northern  lines as well as the mainline stations at King's Cross and  St Pancras [8] The station had four platforms. The two to the south were for the  Metropolitan line , and were used from 1863 to 1940. The two northern platforms, used from 1863 to 1979 and from 1983 to 2007, served the  City Widened Lines  and later the Thameslink service. The southbound Metropolitan and northbound Widened shared an island platform. After closure of the Metropolitan platforms a high wall was built on that island. [1]  The two platforms in use during the King's Cross Thameslink era were lettered rather than numbered, [9]  to avoid confusion with the platforms at nearby King's Cross among staff who worked at both stations. [10] In 1983,  British Rail  introduced the  London station group , a group of stations in central London which were regarded as a single destination for ticketing and fare purposes. King's Cross Midland City, as it was then called, was one of the original eighteen stations in the group, [11]  and it retained this status until closure in 2007. [12] History edit Early history edit Main article:  London King's Cross railway station \u00a7\u00a0History The area of  King's Cross  was previously a village known as Battle Bridge, an ancient crossing of the  River Fleet . The river flowed along what is now the west side of Pancras Road until it was rerouted underground in 1825. [13]  The mainline King's Cross station was built in 1851\u201352 as the London terminus of the  Great Northern Railway  (GNR), and was the fifth London terminal to be constructed. [14]  The station took its name from the  King's Cross building , a monument to  King George IV  that stood in the area and was demolished in 1845. [15]  Plans for the station were made in December 1848 under the direction of  George Turnbull , resident engineer for constructing the first 20 miles (32\u00a0km) of the Great Northern Railway out of London. [16] [17]  The station opened on 14 October 1852. [14]  The first suburban services to and from King's Cross began operating in 1861, initially to Seven Sisters Road station (which was renamed to  Finsbury Park  in 1869), and later to  Hornsey  and beyond.

The intention was to connect the  Great Western Railway  (GWR) at  Paddington  with the  Great Northern Railway  (GNR) at King's Cross. [19] [20]  The line was opened on 10 January 1863, along with six other stations, [3]  as part of the original section of the  Metropolitan Railway , which would later become part of the  London Underground [21]  King's Cross Metropolitan, the predecessor of King's Cross Thameslink, opened at the same time and was located to the east of the mainline station. [22]  The line was initially  dual gauge , enabling both the GWR's  broad gauge  trains and other  standard gauge  stock to run. [23]  Later that year a pair of tunnels\u2014the York Road Curve for southbound trains and the Hotel Curve for northbound trains\u2014were built, joining the GNR lines north of King's Cross mainline with the Metropolitan's line at King's Cross Metropolitan. [24]  The GWR ran the first trains on the line, but relations towards the Metropolitan quickly became strained and the GWR withdrew from the route in August 1863. The Metropolitan was able to continue operating by leasing rolling stock from the GNR, which it brought on to the line through the York Road tunnel. [23]  The GNR started routing all its suburban trains through the tunnels to Farringdon Street (now  Farringdon ) station in October. Trains into London stopped at a new platform known as  King's Cross York Road  to the north east of the mainline station, and again at the Metropolitan station, while trains out of London stopped at the Metropolitan station, and again at the mainline station, by reversing into a platform after exiting the Hotel Curve. [22] In 1866 the  Snow Hill tunnel  was opened, joining the Metropolitan Railway at Farringdon Street to the  London, Chatham and Dover Railway  (LCDR) terminus at  Ludgate Hill [22]  This allowed goods and passenger trains to run from the GNR lines south through to  Herne Hill  and beyond. [22]  The lines became very congested, leading to the opening in 1868 of a new pair of lines known as the  City Widened Lines . These ran alongside the original tracks from King's Cross through to  Moorgate [25]  and allowed GNR and Metropolitan traffic to run along the line simultaneously. [26]  The same year the Metropolitan built a pair of tunnels to the  Midland Railway  tracks north of its new terminus at St Pancras station. [27]  This enabled the Midland to begin running a service from  Bedford  through to Moorgate. [24]  The Midland tunnels as well as the original York Road and Hotel Curve tunnels from King's Cross mainline station were connected to the City Widened Lines, while the link to the original Metropolitan lines was removed. [28]  The original Metropolitan tracks became part of the Inner Circle (later known as the  Circle line ), which ran partly on Metropolitan tracks and partly on  District Railway  tracks. The line was completed in 1884. [29]  Services were provided by both the Metropolitan, which ran the clockwise trains and the District, which ran anticlockwise. [30] The route through King's Cross Metropolitan remained busy throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century, with trains from five companies\u2014the Metropolitan, GNR, Midland, LCDR and the  South Eastern Railway  (SER)\u2014and routes including  Victoria  to Peterborough as well as services from north London to Chatham and Dover. [31]  A service operated from  Liverpool  to  Paris  via the Widened Lines, departing at 08:00 and arriving in Paris by 22:50, having travelled by across the  English Channel  in a paddle steamer. [32]  Trains continued to ascend up the Hotel Curve from the Metropolitan station and reverse into the mainline station until 1878, when a new platform was built on the western side of the GNR tracks. This became known as the King's Cross Suburban station, but suffered from several problems including a steep incline and sharp curve, along with a build-up of smoke because of its proximity to the mouth of the tunnel. [33]  Congestion was somewhat alleviated when a connection between Finsbury Park and  Canonbury  allowed use of the  North London Railway  tracks to take some of the traffic from the GNR lines into  Broad Street station  in the City of London rather than down the Metropolitan line. [34]  In 1892 the station was linked to the concourse of the mainline station by a foot tunnel. [35] Arrival of the deep tube and relocation of Metropolitan platforms edit The advent of deep-level tube lines at the turn of the twentieth century caused major changes in the underground network. The  Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway , later known as the  Piccadilly line , opened a station serving King's Cross and St Pancras in 1906, and the  City & South London Railway , now part of the  Northern line , opened its station the following year. [36]  The tube platforms were linked to King's Cross Metropolitan through the same foot tunnel as the mainline, making one station complex. [35]  The Metropolitan line part of the station was amalgamated in 1933 with the deep-level lines as part of the newly-formed the LPTB. [4]  The arrival of the Piccadilly and Northern lines, as well as the growth of trams on the surface streets, led to a sharp reduction of services on the City Widened Lines. [24]  The SER, LCDR, and GNR services were withdrawn in 1907, and the Midland and LC&DR joint service in June the following year. [37]  The decreased passenger service allowed a growth in freight traffic through the station. During the  First World War  the line was used for freight and troop movements with 250,000 tons of freight and 26,047 special troop trains passing through. Passenger service was reduced to four hours per day during morning and evening peak hours from 1915. [24]  The Snow Hill tunnel closed to passenger service during the war, and the north\u2013south link was used only by freight in the postwar years. [38]  Service on the Circle and Metropolitan line tracks increased over subsequent years, however, following electrification of those tracks in 1905\u201306. [39] The infrastructure around King's Cross was bombed by Germany in 1940 during  the Blitz  early in the  Second World War . The Circle line between Euston Square and King's Cross was particularly damaged and services stopped completely for five months. [40]  When the line reopened in March 1941 a new pair of platforms were opened to the west, making use of abandoned tunnels from the 1860s and providing a shorter connection to the Piccadilly and Northern lines. [24]  This scheme, part of what is now Kings Cross St Pancras tube station, had been planned by the MR since 1935. [10]  The original platforms were abandoned but are still in place and visible from passing trains as of 2019. [24]  After the war, national rail services continued to use the City Widened Lines platforms of the original station from the GNR route (now known as the  East Coast Mainline ) and from the  Midland Mainline [24] Thameslink programme edit Class 319  train at King's Cross Thameslink in 1989 The Snow Hill tunnel, which had seen no passenger services since 1916, closed completely on 24 March 1969 with the withdrawal of freight services; the tracks were lifted in May 1971. [41]  Services from the East Coast line then ended in 1976 after the  Northern City Line  was transferred from London Underground control to British Rail, allowing services to run from Finsbury Park directly to Moorgate avoiding King's Cross. [42]  A handful of services from the Midland line continued to run, but the Widened Lines were almost unused in the late 1970s. [42] In 1979 an \u00a380 million project was launched to electrify the Midland Mainline from Bedford to St Pancras and the City Widened Lines. [42]  The station was closed, along with the line, and work was completed by May 1982. The tracks were lowered to allow for overhead power cables to be installed and several bridges were remodelled. Despite completion of the line and availability of rolling stock by early 1983, the opening of the line was delayed over a dispute with the  Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen  (ASLEF) union regarding  driver-only operation  on the new electric trains. [43]  The station eventually reopened later in 1983, with the new name of King's Cross Midland City. Trains ran between Bedford and Moorgate, via St Pancras and the tunnels from the Midland mainline to the City Widened Lines. [44] In 1988  Network SouthEast , one of the newly created sectors of the state-owned  British Rail [45]  implemented a scheme first proposed in the 1960s to reopen the Snow Hill tunnel to passenger traffic. [38]  The project, and the new north\u2013south connection created, was called  Thameslink . Trains ran between Bedford and  Brighton  using  Class 319  dual-voltage trains which could run on both the Midland Mainline's overhead AC system and the  Brighton Mainline 's third-rail system. [45]  Five years after its previous rename, the station at King's Cross was once again renamed, this time to King's Cross Thameslink. [24]  Services on the line grew and new stations were added, including a station at the southern end of the Snow Hill tunnel named  City Thameslink , which replaced the earlier terminal  Holborn Viaduct station  which was not on the through route. [46] At around the time Thameslink was launched,  British Rail  began active planning for the  Channel Tunnel Rail Link , a new high-speed line to link London with the Channel tunnel. The initial proposal was for the line to end at a new \"King's Cross Low Level\" station, which would run from north west to south east underneath the  Great Northern Hotel  and the mainline terminal, and would become a joint station for  Eurostar  and Thameslink services. [47]  This plan was developed in some detail by architect  Norman Foster , but was ultimately vetoed by the government in 1990 due to high costs. [48]  The project, which became known as High Speed 1, was eventually completed in 2007 with terminal platforms at St Pancras rather than King's Cross. [49] Closure and relocation edit The former ticket office in 2019, now used as an entrance to King's Cross St Pancras tube station In the mid-2000s,  Network Rail  began work on the  Thameslink Programme , a scheme originally proposed in around 1990 but delayed several times. [50] [51]  The plan involved increasing the service frequency between King's Cross and Blackfriars up to 24 trains per hour. [50]  Planners for the programme decided that the existing King's Cross Thameslink station would be unable to cope with this increase. They criticised its substandard platform widths and lengths, lack of step-free access and fire escape routes, as well as the poor-quality passenger environment. [52]  They decided to move the station rather than upgrade it at its existing location. The surrounding infrastructure made this impractical and it would also have caused serious disruption to the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan Underground lines as well as nearby roads. [52]  The siting of the High Speed 1 terminus under St Pancras rather than King's Cross also meant that the Thameslink platforms were a long distance by foot from the planned Eurostar platforms. [53] Network Rail initially considered reusing the abandoned Norman Foster proposal, which had called for a combined Eurostar and Thameslink station underneath King's Cross mainline station, but updated to be for Thameslink only. This would have the advantage of fewer closures to the line during construction, as the site was not on the existing line. Ultimately though, due to the cost of relocating the lines and the political issues with demolishing the Grade-II-listed Great Northern Hotel, Network Rail decided to build the new platforms on the existing alignment, under the St Pancras complex. [48]  The new platforms are close to the  High Speed 1  platforms used by  Eurostar  trains, and provide an easier connection to the mainline stations at St Pancras and King's Cross. [54]  The work required closure of the through Thameslink line for eight months in 2004\u201305, with trains from the north terminating at St Pancras. [53] [55]  The project then stalled but was rescued by extra funding of \u00a363\u00a0million in February 2006. [55]  The last train at King's Cross Thameslink was the 23:59 from  Haywards Heath , which called at the station at 01:08 on Sunday 9 December 2007. [56] \nFrom 9 December 2007, Thameslink services started to call at the new platforms at St Pancras. [57] The foot tunnel from  King's Cross St Pancras tube station  to the ticket office of the former Thameslink station remains open from 07:00 to 20:00 on Mondays to Fridays, to provide extra access to  London Underground  platforms from Pentonville Road. [58] Services edit The off-peak service pattern for King's Cross Thameslink in 2007, the year of its closure, was as follows: [59] 4 tph to  Brighton  via  London Bridge  and  Gatwick Airport 4 tph to  Sutton , 2 tph via  Wimbledon  and 2 tph via  Mitcham Junction 4 tph to  Bedford  via  St Albans City Luton Airport  and  Luton 2 tph to  Luton  via  St Pancras International St Albans City  and  Luton Airport 2 tph to  St Albans City  via  Hendon Preceding station\n Historical railways Following station\n Kentish Town Line and station open First Capital Connect Thameslink Farringdon Line and station open London King's Cross York Road (southbound) Suburban (northbound) Lines closed, station open Great Northern Railway City Widened Lines London, Chatham & Dover Railway City branch Camden Road Line open, station closed Midland Railway Preceding station\n London Underground Following station\n Euston Square Metropolitan Railway 1863\u20131933 Farringdon Metropolitan line 1933\u20131940 Notes edit a b c d e Pedroche 2011 , pp.\u00a030\u201331.

Underground  station on  Euston Road  in the  Borough of Camden , Central  London . It serves  King's Cross  and  St Pancras  main line stations in  fare zone 1 , and is an interchange between six Underground lines. The station was one of the first to open on the network; as of 2017, it is the most used station on the network for passenger entrances and exits combined.\n The station opened in 1863 along with the  Metropolitan line , subsequently catering for the  Hammersmith & City  and  Circle lines . It was expanded in 1868 with the opening of the  City Widened Lines , and the  Northern  and  Piccadilly  platforms opened in the early 20th century. During the 1930s and 1940s, the station was restructured and partially rebuilt to cater for expanded traffic. The  Victoria line  connection opened in 1968. The 1987  King's Cross fire  that killed 31 people is the deadliest accident to occur on the Underground and resulted in widespread safety improvements and changes throughout the network. The station was extensively rebuilt in the early 21st century to cater for  Eurostar  services that moved from  Waterloo  to St Pancras, reopening in 2009.\n Contents 1 History 1.1 Fire 1.2 Upgrade and expansion 2 Ticket halls 3 Artwork 4 Future proposals 4.1 Crossrail 2 4.2 Docklands Light Railway extension from Bank 4.3 Piccadilly line 5 Services 6 Incidents 7 References 8 External links History edit .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}} Interior Exterior Metropolitan Railway station, 1862 before opening The first underground station at King's Cross was planned in 1851, during construction of the mainline station. The intention was to connect the  Great Western Railway  (GWR) at  Paddington  with the  Great Northern Railway  (GNR) at King's Cross. [2] [3]  The line was opened as part of the original section of the  Metropolitan Railway  (MR) on 10 January 1863. [4]  It was reorganised in August 1868 to accommodate the  City Widened Lines  which allowed GNR and Metropolitan traffic to run along the line simultaneously. [5]  The same year, the Metropolitan built a link to the newly opened  St Pancras  station. [6] The  Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway  (GNP&BR, now part of the Piccadilly line) platforms opened with the rest of the line on 15 December 1906, while the  City & South London Railway  (C&SLR, now part of the Northern line) opened on 11 May 1907. [7]  In 1927, this part of the station was renamed as King's Cross for St Pancras. [8] In 1933, the station was formally renamed King's Cross St Pancras, except for the Metropolitan line station, which continued to use the old name until 16 October 1940, when it was also renamed. [8]  During this time, major rebuilding work took place, including a direct connection to St Pancras and a circular ticket hall. The main concourse opened on 18 June 1939, and the subway link to St Pancras opened two years later. [9]  The total cost of the work was \u00a3260,000. [10] The Metropolitan line platforms were closed between 16 October and 9 December 1940 due to bomb damage during  the Blitz [11] [a]  Further bomb damage to the Metropolitan line platforms occurred on 9 March 1941 when a train, the station roof, the signal box and the platforms were damaged and two railway staff were killed. [13]  New sub-surface platforms had been under construction as part of the station improvements begun in the 1930s and these were opened in an unfinished condition on 14 March 1941 250\u00a0m (270\u00a0yd) to the west. [13]  These were decorated with cream tiles featuring pale green edges. A subway was built between the sub-surface lines, running below  Euston Road  and joining with the tube lines, making interchanging between the various lines easier. [14]  The 1868 platforms later became  King's Cross Thameslink  station. [15] The Victoria line platforms were opened on 1 December 1968 as part of the line's second phase from  Highbury & Islington  to  Warren Street . Unlike some other interchange stations on the line, it was not possible to put the platforms on the same level with other lines. [b]  Two new escalators were constructed, connecting the Northern / Piccadilly ticket hall with an expanded concourse. A further subway and staircase connected the new platforms to this. [17] The station was refurbished in 1986, in conjunction with several others on the tube network. The Northern and Piccadilly platforms were decorated with multi-coloured tiles featuring the letters \"K\" and \"X\". [18] Fire edit Memorial plaque with the clock to the  1987 fire  in the station Main article:  King's Cross fire The underground network had been at risk of fire since opening, and the limited amount of space and means of escape increased the possibility of fatalities. Following a serious fire at  Finsbury Park  in February 1976, staff had been trained to be alert for any possible causes of ignition or smouldering. [19] At around 7:30\u00a0p.m. on 18 November 1987, a passenger reported a small fire on the Northern / Piccadilly up escalator and alerted staff. The incident was judged as relatively minor, and the Fire Brigade arrived at 7:43\u00a0p.m. with four pumps and a ladder. By this time, the ticket hall had filled with smoke, trains passed through the station without stopping, and passengers were being evacuated. At around 7:45\u00a0p.m., a fireball erupted from the Northern / Piccadilly escalators and set the ticket hall ablaze. The fire burned for several hours and was not properly contained until around 1:46\u00a0a.m. the following morning. It killed 31 people, including a fire officer. [19] The then-unknown fire phenomenon of the  trench effect  made the fire develop upwards and finally caused it to explode into the station. [20]  As a result, fire safety procedures on the Underground were tightened, staff training was improved and wooden steps on escalators were replaced with metal ones. Smoking had already been banned on subsurface areas of the Underground in February 1985; following the King's Cross fire, it was banned throughout the entire network. [19] [21]  The fire caused extensive damage, particularly to the old wooden escalators where it had started. Repairs and rebuilding took over a year; the Northern line platforms and the escalators from the ticket hall to the Piccadilly line remained closed until 5 March 1989. [19] [22] Upgrade and expansion edit Northwest entrance to the Western ticket hall under St Pancras The Northern ticket hall, under the new King's Cross concourse, which opened in 2009 In the aftermath of the fire, the Fennell Report recommended that London Underground should investigate \"passenger flow and congestion in stations and take remedial action\". [20]  Consequently, a Parliamentary bill was tabled in 1993 to permit London Underground to improve and expand the congested station. [23] In 2000, work began to upgrade and expand the station in conjunction with the  Channel Tunnel Rail Link  project, in which St Pancras would be the new terminal for  Eurostar  services to continental Europe. The upgrade took almost 10 years to complete at a cost of \u00a3810m, doubling the capacity of the station to more than 100,000\u00a0people daily. [24]  Two new ticket halls were built \u2013 the Western Ticket Hall under the forecourt of St Pancras station, [25]  and the Northern Ticket Hall under the new King's Cross station concourse. [24]  The existing ticket hall in front of  King's Cross  station was rebuilt and expanded. New passageways and escalators were provided to increase capacity, and ten new lifts were installed to make the station step-free. [26] [27]  King's Cross Thameslink station closed on 9 December 2007 after the service moved to St Pancras. [15] The upgraded station was opened by the  Mayor of London Boris Johnson , and the  Minister for London Tessa Jowell  on 29 November 2009. Jowell said that the improvements would be vital to help passenger movement during the  London 2012 Olympics [24] Ticket halls edit Following completion of the station upgrade in 2010, King's Cross St Pancras has eleven entrances and four ticket halls. [28] The \"Tube Ticket Hall\" in front of  King's Cross  station was expanded and refurbished in the station upgrade and is signposted as the 'Euston Road' way out from the Tube lines. [28] The \"Pentonville Road\" entrance was the former ticket hall for  King's Cross Thameslink station . It has underground passageway connections to the Piccadilly and Victoria lines. It was taken over by London Underground when the Thameslink platforms closed. [29] The \"Western Ticket Hall\" is under the forecourt of  St Pancras  station adjacent to  Euston Road . It opened on 28 May 2006 providing access to St Pancras Station via the St Pancras undercroft. [25] The \"Northern Ticket Hall\" is west of  King's Cross  station under the concourse of the mainline station. The new ticket hall and its connections to the Tube lines were opened on 29 November 2009. [24]  It is signposted as the \"Regent's Canal\" exit. [30] Artwork edit Tiled motif on the Victoria line platforms The stations along the central part of the Piccadilly line, the  Bakerloo line  and some sections of the Northern line, were financed by the American entrepreneur  Charles Tyson Yerkes [31]  and known for the  Leslie Green -designed red station buildings and distinctive platform tiling. Each station was designed with a unique tile pattern and colours. [32] Like other stations on the line, the  Victoria line  platforms at the station have a tiled motif in the seat recesses. The design by artist  Tom Eckersley  features a cross of crowns. [33] [34] In the 2000s upgrade,  Art on the Underground  commissioned the first permanent artwork to be installed on the Underground since the 1980s. [35]  The stainless steel sculptures,  Full Circle  by artist Knut Henrik Henriksen, are located at the end of two new concourses on the Northern and Piccadilly lines. [36] Future proposals edit Crossrail 2 edit In 1991, a route for a potential Chelsea-Hackney line was safeguarded through the area. [37] [38]  This proposal has since evolved into a proposed rail route based on  Crossrail  called  Crossrail 2 , which would link both  Euston  and King's Cross St Pancras, into the station  Euston St Pancras [39] [30]  This proposed scheme would offer a second rail link between King's Cross and  Victoria  in addition to the Victoria line. In the 2007 safeguarded route, the next stations would be  Tottenham Court Road  and  Angel [40] Docklands Light Railway extension from Bank edit In 2011, strategy documents by  Transport for London  (TfL) and supported by the  London Borough of Camden  proposed an extension of the  Docklands Light Railway  (DLR) Bank branch to Euston and St Pancras to help relieve the Northern line between Euston and Bank, which would offer direct connections to  Canary Wharf  and  London City Airport [41]  TfL have considered a line from  Bank  via  City Thameslink  and  Holborn  to the two transport hubs but may not be developed until the full separation of the Northern line happens. [42] [43] [44] [45] Piccadilly line edit In 2005, a business case was prepared to re-open the disused  York Road Underground station  on the Piccadilly line, to serve the  King's Cross Central  development and help relieve congestion at King's Cross St Pancras. [46]  York Road station closed in September 1932 and was around 600\u00a0m (660\u00a0yd) north of King's Cross St Pancras. [47] Services edit The station is in  zone 1  of the London fare system. [48]  In addition to the two mainline stations, the station services six underground lines. There are the  Circle Hammersmith & City Metropolitan  (these three share a single pair of tracks), Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines. In 2017, King's Cross St Pancras was the most used station on the system, with  97.92  million passengers entering and exiting the station. [1] Several London bus routes serve the station, including  10 30 45 59 63  and  73 [49] Preceding station\n London Underground Following station\n Euston Square towards\u00a0 Hammersmith Circle line Farringdon towards\u00a0 Edgware Road  (via\u00a0 Aldgate Hammersmith & City line Farringdon towards\u00a0 Barking Euston Square towards\u00a0 Amersham Chesham Uxbridge  or  Watford Metropolitan line Farringdon towards\u00a0 Aldgate Euston towards\u00a0 Edgware Mill Hill East or  High Barnet Northern line City Branch Angel towards\u00a0 Morden  (via  Bank Russell Square towards\u00a0 Uxbridge  or  Heathrow Airport Terminal\u00a04  or  Terminal\u00a05 Piccadilly line Caledonian Road towards\u00a0 Cockfosters Euston towards\u00a0 Brixton Victoria line Highbury & Islington towards\u00a0 Walthamstow Central Proposed services Russell Square towards\u00a0 Uxbridge  or  Heathrow Airport Terminal\u00a04  or  Terminal\u00a05 Piccadilly line York Way towards\u00a0 Cockfosters Abandoned plans Euston Square towards  Hammersmith tube station Kensington (Addison Road) Uxbridge Chesham Verney Junction  or  Brill Metropolitan Railway Clerkenwell towards  Whitechapel Former services Euston Square towards\u00a0 Hammersmith Metropolitan line Hammersmith branch  (1864\u20131990) Farringdon towards\u00a0 Barking Russell Square towards\u00a0 South Harrow Piccadilly line (1906\u20131932) York Road towards\u00a0 Finsbury Park Incidents edit On 2 January 1885, an  Irish Nationalist  terrorist planted a bomb on the Metropolitan line just west of the station. There were no injuries and little damage as the bomb exploded in the tunnel rather than on any train. James Cunningham was arrested later that month and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour for causing the attack. [50] On 28 May 1959, the leading car on a Northern line train derailed just after leaving King's Cross St Pancras, heading for Euston. There were no injuries. [51] The  7 July 2005 London bombings  were a series of co-ordinated bomb attacks, including an explosion in a Piccadilly line train travelling between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square which killed 26 people. [52] [53]  The death toll was the highest of all the incidents, as the Piccadilly line is in a deep tube south of King's Cross and there was nowhere for the blast to escape. [52] References edit Notes The same bombing raid also destroyed the glass roof and signal box at St Pancras mainline station. [12] Cross-platform interchanges were constructed between Victoria line platforms and those of other lines at Finsbury Park, Highbury & Islington, Euston and Oxford Circus.

employees 37,000 [4] Website www .networkrail .co .uk Network Rail  is the owner (via its subsidiary Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd, which was known as Railtrack plc before 2002) [5]  and  infrastructure manager  of most of the railway network in  Great Britain [6]  Network Rail is an  arm's length public body  of the  Department for Transport  with no shareholders, which reinvests its income in the railways.\n Network Rail's main customers are the private  train operating companies  (TOCs), responsible for passenger transport, and  freight operating companies  (FOCs), who provide train services on the infrastructure that the company owns and maintains. Since 1 September 2014, Network Rail has been classified as a \"public sector body\". [7] To cope with  quickly rising passenger numbers , Network Rail is currently undertaking a \u00a338 billion  programme of upgrades  to the network, including  Crossrail electrification of lines upgrading Thameslink  and a new  high-speed line Contents 1 History 1.1 Pre-2002 1.2 2002 onwards 1.3 Allegations of misuse of public funds and discrimination 1.4 Knighthood of John Armitt 1.5 Regional reorganisation 1.6 Flying Scotsman cancellation 1.7 Great Western Electrification 1.8 Sharing of responsibility with TOCs 2 Responsibilities 3 Funding 4 Assets 4.1 Infrastructure 4.2 Stations 4.3 Training facilities 4.4 Telecoms assets 4.5 Rolling stock 5 Development 5.1 Current investment programme 5.2 The GRIP process 5.3 Control periods 5.4 Route plans 5.5 Electricity 6 Governance structure and accountability 6.1 Formal governance structure 6.2 Monitoring Network Rail's performance 6.3 Informal governance groups 6.3.1 Railway Industry Planning Group (RIPG) 6.4 Directors 7 Safety 8 Private versus public-sector status 9 National Centre 10 Photography competition 11 See also 12 References 13 External links History edit Pre-2002 edit See also:  Railtrack  and  British Rail Britain's railway system  was built by private companies, but it was nationalised by the  Transport Act 1947  and run by  British Railways  until  re-privatisation  which was begun in 1994 and completed in 1997. Infrastructure, passenger and freight services were separated at that time. Between 1994 and 2002 the infrastructure was owned and operated by  Railtrack The  Hatfield train crash  on 17 October 2000 was a defining moment in the collapse of Railtrack. [8]  The immediate major repairs undertaken across the whole British railway network were estimated to have cost in the order of  580 million and Railtrack had no idea how many more 'Hatfields' were waiting to happen because it had lost considerable in-house engineering skill following the sale or closure of many of the engineering and maintenance functions of  British Rail  to external companies; nor did the company have any way of assessing the consequence of the speed restrictions it was ordering, which all but brought the railway network to a standstill. [9]  The costs of modernising the  West Coast Main Line  were also spiralling. [10]  In 2001, Railtrack announced that, despite making a pre-tax profit before exceptional expenses of \u00a3199m, the \u00a3733m of costs and compensation paid out over the Hatfield crash had plunged Railtrack from profit into a loss of \u00a3534m, [11]  and it approached the government for funding, which it then used to pay a \u00a3137m dividend to its shareholders in May 2001. [12] Network Rail Ltd took over control by buying  Railtrack  plc, which was in \"railway administration\", from Railtrack Group plc for \u00a3500 million; Railtrack plc was then renamed and reconstituted as Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd. The purchase was completed on 3 October 2002. [13]  The former company had thus never ceased to exist but continued under another name: for this reason Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd was the defendant in later prosecutions in respect of events which had occurred in the days of Railtrack.\n 2002 onwards edit UK total rail subsidies 1986\u20132015 (in 2015 terms), showing the huge increase after the Hatfield crash. [14] Following an initial period in which Network Rail established itself and demonstrated its competence in addressing the principal challenges of improving asset condition, reducing unit costs and tackling delay, the Government's Rail Review in 2004 said that Network Rail should be given responsibility for whole-industry performance reporting, timetable development, specification of small and medium network enhancements, and the delivery of route-specific utilisation strategies (RUS). [15]  Some of these are functions which Network Rail already had; others \u2013 such as the obligation to devise  route utilisation strategies  \u2013 were transferred to Network Rail from the  Strategic Rail Authority , a non-departmental public body, part of the UK government. The SRA was abolished in November 2006. [16] The company moved its headquarters to Kings Place, 90 York Way, from 40 Melton Street, Euston, in August 2008. In October 2008, Sir  Ian McAllister  announced that he would not stand for re-election as chairman of Network Rail. He had held the position for six years. He noted that as Network Rail moved to a \"new phase in its development\" it was appropriate for a new chairman to lead it there. [17] Many track safety initiatives have been introduced in the time Network Rail has been responsible for this area. The latest, announced in December 2008, known as \"All Orange\", states that all track personnel must not only wear orange hi-vis waistcoats or jackets, but must also wear orange hi-vis trousers at all times when working on or near the track. This ruling came into force in January 2009 for maintenance and property workers and in April 2009 for infrastructure and investment sites. [18] Allegations of misuse of public funds and discrimination edit In 2009, allegations appeared in the media from the  Transport Salaried Staffs' Association  concerning treatment of Network Rail employees. Former chief executive  Iain Coucher  was also accused of financial impropriety involving unspecified payments to his business partner Victoria Pender during his tenure at Network Rail. [19] An internal investigation held by Network Rail in 2010, vetted by its auditors  PricewaterhouseCoopers , uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing. An independent enquiry headed by Anthony White QC in 2011 further examined the claims, but also exonerated Coucher. [20] [21] Knighthood of John Armitt edit Critical commentary appeared in the media concerning the  knighthood  awarded to John Armitt in the  2012 New Year Honours  for services to engineering and construction. Armitt was Chief Executive of Network Rail at the time of the 2007  Grayrigg derailment  and the family of a victim of the accident criticised the award, which coincidentally was conferred on the same day that Network Rail were prosecuted for the accident. [22] Regional reorganisation edit In 2011 the company began the process of reorganising its operational structure into nine semi-autonomous regional entities, each with their own managing director; the first two units to be created were Scotland and Wessex regions. [23] [24]  The reorganisation has been interpreted as a move back towards vertical integration of track and train operations. [25] Flying Scotsman cancellation edit In 2016 Network Rail failed to check whether the  Flying Scotsman  could fit through tunnels along the Borders Route resulting in the cancellation of a trip just 24 hours before departure. The operator described the cancellation as \"an absolute disgrace\", Network Rail blamed the cancellation on an internal \"administrative error\". [26]  Just one day later Network Rail chose to change their mind and allow the train journey to take place. Scottish Transport Minister  Derek Mackay  branded the affair a \"debacle\". [27] Great Western Electrification edit Network Rail's attempt to electrify the  Great Western Main Line  has been dogged by poor planning and cost overruns. [28]  The projected cost had increased from \u00a31.2 billion to \u00a32.8 billion by the end of 2015 [29]  and the project has been delayed to the point where the government has asked Hitachi to retrofit the new Intercity Express Programme trainsets with diesel as well as electric engines as the electrification has been scaled back. [30] Sharing of responsibility with TOCs edit In December 2016, the Transport Secretary,  Chris Grayling  announced that Network Rail would lose sole control of track maintenance and repairs, and instead would share this with the Train Operating Companies. [31] [32] [33] Responsibilities edit Sign showing the Network Rail name on the  signal box  at  Ledbury Network Rail owns the infrastructure, including the railway tracks, signals, overhead wires, tunnels, bridges, level crossings and most stations, but not the passenger or commercial freight rolling stock. It however owns a fleet of  departmental stock Although it owns over 2,500 railway stations, it manages only 20 of the biggest and busiest of them, all the other stations being managed by one or other of the various train operating companies (TOCs). [34]  Network Rail has a 15-year lease on Square One in Manchester with 800 staff in one of Manchester's largest refurbished office spaces. [35] Network Rail should not be confused with ' National Rail '. National Rail is not an organisation, but merely a brand, used to explain and promote a Great Britain-wide network of passenger railway services. The majority of Network Rail lines also carry freight traffic; some lines are freight only. A few lines that carry passenger traffic are not part of the National Rail network (for example  High Speed 1 Heathrow Express Tyne and Wear Metro  (the Tyne and Wear Metro uses Network Rail track between Pelaw and Sunderland and is responsible for that) and the  London Underground ). Conversely, a few National Rail services operate over track which is not part of the Network Rail network. For example, Chiltern Railways services run on track owned by London Underground between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Amersham.\n The current Chairman is  Sir Peter Hendy , and  Andrew Haines OBE  was appointed as the Chief Executive in August 2018. [2] Funding edit Main article:  Financing of the rail industry in Great Britain Network Rail is funded partly through a direct grant from the government (\u00a33.8 billion in 2015/16) and partly by train operating companies paying access charges to use the rail network (\u00a31.6 billion in 2015/16).  In 2015/16, it spent \u00a33.1 billion on renewals (renewing existing infrastructure back to how it was when new) and \u00a33.2 billion on enhancements, with the rest spent on maintenance and other costs. [36] Assets edit Infrastructure edit Network Rail depot at  Norwood Junction station Croydon Unimog bucket truck High-pressure water jets clearing leaves at  Taunton Network Rail covers 20,000 miles of track, and 40,000 bridges and tunnels. [37] In October 2003 Network Rail announced that it would take over all infrastructure maintenance work from private contractors, following concerns about the quality of work carried out by certain private firms, and spiralling costs. [38] February 2004 saw the opening of an operations centre at  Waterloo station  in London, operated jointly by Network Rail and  South West Trains . This was the first full collaboration of its kind since privatisation, and it is regarded as a model for other areas of the network, with a further six integrated Network Rail + TOC Control Centres having opened since then, at  Blackfriars Croydon  (Leading Control for Thameslink),  Swindon Birmingham New Street Glasgow  and, most recently,  Liverpool Street  and South Wales based in Cardiff Canton. citation needed Track renewal, the ongoing modernisation of the railway network by replacing track and signalling, continues to be carried out by private engineering firms under contract. The biggest renewals projects include the multibillion-pound upgrade of the London \u2013 Glasgow  West Coast Main Line , which was completed in 2008, the  Thameslink Programme  to upgrade the north-south railway through London and work on the part of  Crossrail  which is operated by Network Rail. [39] Network Rail initially sub-contracted much of the work and the site to private infrastructure maintenance companies such as  Carillion  and  First Engineering . Other sub-contractors are used on site for specialist work or additional labour. These include Prima Services Group, Sky Blue, Balfour Beatty, Laboursite, BCL, Atkins (Atkins Rail) and McGinleys. citation needed Since 2003 Network Rail has been building up significant in-house engineering skills, including funding of apprenticeship and foundation degree schemes. Network Rail reports significant savings resulting from the initial transfers of work away from contracting companies. Additional contracts were taken back by Network Rail after the serious  accident at Potters Bar  and other accidents at Rotherham and King's Cross led Jarvis to pull out of the track repair business. Shortly after this, and due to other failures by maintenance companies, Network Rail took control of many more maintenance duties. Telecomms maintenance came full circle in April 2009 with the bringing in house of the staff of Thales Telecom Services Ltd (formerly  British Rail Telecommunications  (BRT)). citation needed In 2006, Network Rail made public a high-tech plan to combat the effects of  slippery rail . This plan involves the use of satellites for tracking trouble areas, water-jetting trains and crews using railhead scrubbers, sand sticks and a substance called Natrusolve, which dissolves leaf mulch. [40] All workers working on, near or trackside have to undergo a  Personal Track Safety  assessment (re-assessed every two years). [41]  Network Rail workers undergo an assessment every year as part of AITL (Assessment in the Line). The AITL requires each worker to go through questions on a computer based program on all the competencies held. citation needed In 2007 it was announced that the number of track renewal contractors will be reduced to four from the current six.\nThese are now  Amey SECO Balfour Beatty Babcock First Engineering  and  Jarvis plc [42]  Jarvis went into administration in March 2010, [43]  with the bulk of its work commitments being picked up by Babcock. citation needed Stations edit Network Rail owns more than 2,500 railway stations, divided into  six categories . Management and operation of most of them is carried out mostly by the principal  train operating company  serving that station; however, in a few cases the train operating company does not serve the station. For example,  Hinckley  is served by  CrossCountry , but it is managed by  East Midlands Trains . As of April 2018, Network Rail manages 20 stations directly, with Clapham Junction and Guildford becoming managed stations on 1 April 2018.   [34] [44]  The stations Network Rail operate are:\n National Birmingham New Street Bristol Temple Meads Clapham Junction Edinburgh Waverley Glasgow Central Guildford Leeds Liverpool Lime Street Manchester Piccadilly Reading Central London stations London Bridge London Cannon Street London Charing Cross London Euston London King's Cross London Liverpool Street London Paddington London St Pancras  (but not the floor which is used for Eurostar services) London Victoria London Waterloo Network Rail High Speed also operates  London St Pancras International  High Level,  Stratford International  and  Ebbsfleet International . Glasgow Central and Liverpool Lime Street stations are divided into high and low-level stations \u2013 the high-level stations are all termini used primarily by the main inter-city services to those stations. The low-level stations are through routes on local commuter networks that are largely separate from other routes to the main station; these platforms are not managed by Network Rail, but instead the rail operator that primarily uses them ( Abellio ScotRail  and  Merseyrail  respectively).\n Network Rail operated  Gatwick Airport  station until January 2012 when it was transferred to  Southern , and  Fenchurch Street  until November 2014 when it was transferred to  c2c . Network Rail took over management of Bristol Temple Meads and Reading in April 2014. [45] A DfT franchise report in 2014 stated Network Rail's intention to subsume more major stations into Network Rail's directly operated portfolio. The report earmarked  York  for Network Rail management, as well as  Manchester Oxford Road  and  Manchester Victoria  which are currently undergoing major rebuilding as part of the  Northern Hub [46]  However as of September\u00a02017 [update]  the two Manchester stations remain under the operatorship of  Northern [47] [48] Training facilities edit Network Rail's Coventry leadership development centre, Westwood. Network Rail has several training and development sites around Britain. These include sites in York, Peterborough, Derby, Leeds,  Walsall  and  Larbert  which provide refresher courses, and train staff in new equipment. Advanced Apprentice Scheme trainees are trained at Network Rail's Westwood training centre for the first five months of their apprenticeship and then are trained further at  HMS  Sultan  in Gosport over seven 2-week periods or five 3-week periods (throughout their second and third year) of their apprenticeship, using a combination of  Royal Navy  facilities and a specially installed training centre. All courses are taught by VT Flagship (part of  Babcock International ) in the first year but apprentices are trained by Network Rail staff in the second and third years. [49]  Network Rail bought a residential centre from  Cable and Wireless  in the Westwood Business Centre near  Coventry  for leadership development. The company and other industry partners such as  VolkerRail  and Balfour Beatty also operate a Foundation Degree in conjunction with Sheffield Hallam University.\n In 2008, Network Rail piloted its first qualification in \"track engineering\". It has been given permission to develop courses equivalent to GCSE and A-levels. [50] Telecoms assets edit Network Rail operates various essential telecommunication circuits for signalling and electrification control systems, train radio systems, lineside communications, level crossing CCTV, station information and security systems as well as more general IT and business telephony needs. The fixed bearer network infrastructure comprises transmission systems and telephone exchanges linked by a fibre optic and copper cable network that is located mainly within trackside troughing routes on the former  British Rail Telecommunications  network. (It is the largest private telecoms network in the UK).\n Network Rail operates several analogue radio networks that support mobile communication applications for drivers and lineside workers which consist of base stations, antenna systems and control equipment. The National Radio Network (NRN) was developed specifically for the operational railway; it provides radio coverage for 98% of the rail network through 500 base stations and 21 radio exchanges. The Radio Electronic Token Block  RETB  system is based on similar technology as the NRN and ORN but provides data communication for signalling token exchange as well as voice communication. citation needed Fixed communication at trackside is provided by telephone. These are primarily provided for signallers to communicate with train crew, via telephones mounted on signal posts, and with the public through telephones located at level crossings.\nGAI-Tronics provides many of the telephones sited on trackside and at level crossings. They also provide Public Access Help Points on platforms and stations to provide passengers with easy access to Information and Emergency control centres.\n GSM-R  radio systems are being introduced across  Europe  under  EU  legislation for interoperability. In the UK, as of March 2014, Network Rail is well underway in the UK implementation of GSM-R to replace its legacy National Radio Network (NRN) and Cab Secure Radio (CSR) systems currently in use.\n Network Rail has an internal infrastructure database known as GEOGIS. The system uses codes for four-digit Track IDs to identify which line at any location is referred to. The first number refers to track direction, with values of 1 (Up), 2 (Down), 3 (Reversible/Bi-directional), or 4 (Merry Go Round Loop). The second number refers to track use, which can be 1 (Main or Fast), 2 (Slow, Local or Relief), 3 (Goods), 4 (Single line), 5 (Loop), 6 (Terminal or Bay), 7 (Crossover), 8 (Other or Engine), or 9 (Single Siding). The third and fourth numbers refer to the track number, which can be any number from 00 to 99 inclusive, and are usually numbered sequentially. [51] Rolling stock edit Network Rail operates a large variety of DMUs, locomotives and rolling stock to perform safety checks and maintenance (this fleet is not to be confused with the combined rolling stock assets of  ATOC  members who work in combination as  National Rail ). As well as the multiple units and locomotives detailed below, Network Rail own and operate a large stock of rolling stock for particular testing duties and track maintenance. Network Rail also hire freight locomotives from various freight operators including  DB Cargo UK Freightliner Colas Rail  and  GB Railfreight  amongst others to operate engineers' trains in support of maintenance and renewal work. Network Rail's Infrastructure Monitoring fleet of test trains is operated by Colas Rail, primarily using locomotives from Colas' and Network Rail's own fleets, but also using locomotives hired from other companies such as  Direct Rail Services , GB Railfreight and  Europhoenix  as required.\n Class\n Image\n Type\n Introduced\n Fleet Size\n Class 73 Electro-diesel locomotive 1962,1965\u20131967\n 3\n Class 97 Diesel Locomotive 1960\u201365\n 4\n Class 117 Diesel Multiple Unit 1961\n 1\n Class 121 Diesel Multiple Unit 1960\n 1\n Class 313 Electric multiple unit 1976\u201377\n 1\n NMT High Speed Train 2003 (built between 1975 & 1982) 1\n MPV Diesel Multiple Unit 1999\n 50 (some stored)\n Class 950 Diesel Multiple Unit 1987\n 1\n Mark 2 Carriage carriage 1963\u201375\n DBSO Control car 2007 (converted from  BSO  in 1979, and 1985\u201386) 5\n DVT Control car 2013\n 4\n Class 489 Control car 2006 (converted from  2HAP EMU  in 1983) 3\n Development edit Current investment programme edit See also:  Timeline of future railway upgrades in Britain Rail Passengers in Great Britain from 1829\u20132018, showing the early era of small railway companies, the amalgamation into the \"Big Four\", nationalisation and finally the current era of privatisation. From 1997 to 2014 (inclusive), passenger numbers have more than doubled, following little growth in the previous decades. To cope with the increasing passenger numbers, Network Rail is currently undertaking a \u00a338 billion  programme of upgrades  to the network, including  Crossrail electrification of lines in-cab signalling , new  inter-city trains upgrading Thameslink , and a new  high-speed line The GRIP process edit For investment projects, as opposed to routine maintenance, Network Rail has developed an eight-stage process designed to minimise and mitigate risks. This is known as the Governance for Railway Investment Projects (GRIP), previously known as \u201cGuide to Rail Investment Projects\u201d. [52]  The stages are as follows:\n output definition; pre-feasibility; option selection; single option development; detailed design; construction, test and commission; scheme hand back; project close out. Each stage delivers an agreed set of outputs to defined quality criteria. [52] Control periods edit Main article:  Network Rail Control Periods For financial and other planning purposes, Network Rail works within 5-year \"Control Periods\", each one beginning on 1 April and ending on 31 March to coincide with the financial reporting year. These periods were inherited from Railtrack, so that the earlier ones are retrospective, and not necessarily of 5 years duration. They are as follows:\n Control Period 1 (CP1): 1996\u20132001 Control Period 2 (CP2): 2001\u20132004 Control Period 3 (CP3): 2004\u20132009 Control Period 4 (CP4): 2009\u20132014 Control Period 5 (CP5): 2014\u20132019 Control Period 6 (CP6): 2019\u20132024 Control Period 7 (CP7): 2024\u20132029 Control Period 8 (CP8): 2029\u20132034 The  Secretary of State for Transport  regularly issues a  High-Level Output Specification  (HLOS) indicating what work the Government wishes to be undertaken during a given Control Period. [53] Route plans edit Strategic Routes in England and Wales 2014. Network Rail regularly publishes a Strategic Business Plan detailing their policies, processes and plans, as well as financial expenditure and other data. The most recent complete business plan was published in January 2013. [54]  Within these plans the rail network is divided into ten \u201cdevolved routes\u201d or \u201coperational routes\u201d, with a Route Plan for each being published annually. [54] \nEach route or other plan covers a number of railway lines usually defined by geographical area and the routes are further subdivided into 17 \u201cstrategic routes\u201d, each divided into Strategic Route Sections (SRS) and given an SRS number and name. [55]  The plans also detail the geography of routes, stations, major junctions, capacity constraints and other issues and provide data on  freight gauge electrification , line speed, number of tracks, capacity and other information. The plans also detail the expected future demand and development of each route, their predicted expenditure and their maintenance and investment requirements. [56] The devolved routes were introduced in 2011, [57]  and the 17 strategic routes labelled \"A\" to \"Q\" were introduced in 2010. From 2004 to 2009, the network had been divided into 26 strategic routes numbered \"1\" to \"26\". In 2003, the network had been divided into 41 strategic routes numbered \"1\" to \"41\". [58] The 2011 devolved routes and strategic routes are organised as in the table below.

The roof of the bridge has been covered with 4,400  photovoltaic panels , providing up to half of the energy for London  Blackfriars station [59] Governance structure and accountability edit Formal governance structure edit The company is accountable to a body of members through its corporate constitution, [60]  to its commercial train operator customers through its contracts with them (the contracts are subject to regulatory oversight), and to the public interest through the statutory powers of the  Office of Rail and Road  (ORR). [61] Since Network Rail does not have shareholders, its members hold the board of directors to account for their management of the business. From 1 July 2015 all the members were removed leaving the special member, the  Secretary of State for Transport , as the sole member of Network Rail. [62] Previously at any one time there were around 100 members in total, drawn from a wide range of industry partners and members of the public. There were two general categories of membership, industry members comprising any organisation holding a licence to operate on the railway or preferred bidder for a railway franchise, and public members who were drawn from the wider stakeholder community. Members were appointed by an independent panel and served a three-year term. They had a number of statutory rights and duties which included attending annual general meetings, receiving the Annual Report and Accounts, and approving the appointment or re-appointment of Network Rail\u2019s directors. Members had a duty to act in the best interests of the company without personal bias. They received no payments other than travel expenses. citation needed Setting the strategic direction and the day-to-day management of Network Rail is the responsibility of the company\u2019s board of directors. That direction must be consistent with the regulatory jurisdiction of the ORR, and with the requirements of its contracts. The ORR in turn operates within the overall transport policy set by the UK  Department for Transport  and the  Scottish government , including as to what the government wants the railway industry to achieve and how much money the government is prepared to put into the industry. This means that the degree of government influence and control over the company is higher than it was before these enlargements of the powers and role of the government were introduced by the  Railways Act 2005 citation needed Monitoring Network Rail's performance edit The  Office of Rail and Road  (ORR) monitors Network Rail's performance on a continuous basis against targets established by the regulatory authority in the most recent access charges review (2003), against obligations in the company's network licence and against forecasts in its own business plan. If performance is poor, the company will face criticism and possible enforcement action from its commercial customers (under their contracts) and from the ORR (enforcing the company's network licence). It may also be criticised by its members in general meeting. citation needed In the annual report 2014/15, the ORR reported that the  Public Performance Measure  (PPM) was 89.6%, 1.4 percentage points (pp) below target in England and Wales, and PPM in Scotland was 90.5%, 1.5pp below its regulatory performance target of 92%. [63] Informal governance groups edit Railway Industry Planning Group (RIPG) edit The Railway Industry Planning Group (RIPG), chaired by Network Rail, has as its purpose railway industry input into the structure and development of the national railway strategic planning processes. Its members are drawn from railway funders, operators and users, [64]  and the group meets quarterly to consider: citation needed rail industry liaison with regional and local government Regional (and Scotland and Wales) Planning Assessments Route Utilisation Strategies specification of passenger operator franchises High Level Output Specifications and Network Rail\u2019s Strategic Business Plan Network Rail\u2019s Business Planning Criteria, Business Plan and Route Plans.

[66] While generally good, the safety record of the company was marred in February 2007 when a Virgin express  derailed at Grayrigg  in  Cumbria . Network Rail admitted responsibility for the incident. The  RAIB  investigation concluded in 2009 that a faulty set of points had caused the derailment. [67]  In 2012 the  Office of Rail Regulation  announced that Network Rail was to be prosecuted under the  Health and Safety Act  for \"failure to provide and implement suitable and sufficient standards, procedures, guidance, training, tools and resources for the inspection and maintenance of fixed stretcher bar points\".  Network Rail pleaded guilty and were fined \u00a34.1 million including legal costs. [68] [69] In December 2005 two young girls were killed by a train as they were crossing the railway line via a pedestrian  level crossing  at  Elsenham  in Essex. Network Rail was prosecuted for breaching  health and safety  law and fined \u00a31 million in March 2012. The court heard that risk assessments carried out by Network Rail staff in 2002 had identified potential dangers with the crossing and recommended the installation of gates that would lock automatically as trains approached, but this was not acted upon. [70] Private versus public-sector status edit See also:  Railtrack In 2001 the then Labour government denied that it had nationalised the rail network in order to prevent Railtrack's shareholders claiming, via the European Court of Human Rights, the four-year average price of Railtrack, about \u00a310 per share. Instead, Railtrack's shareholders were given only \u00a32.60. [71] The Times  reported that Gordon Brown's aide,  Shriti Vadera  e-mailed  Stephen Byers  in July 2001 asking: \"Can we engineer the solution through insolvency ... and therefore avoid  compensation  under the  Human Rights Act [72] Railtrack  plc was placed into railway administration under the  Railways Act 1993  on 7 October 2001, following an application to the  High Court  by the then  Transport Secretary , Stephen Byers. [73]  It was reported in November 2001 that a further \u00a33.5 billion might be needed to keep the national railway network running, a sum disputed by  Ernst & Young , the administrators. [74]  To get Railtrack out of administration, the government had to go back to the High Court and present evidence that the company was no longer insolvent. The principal reason given by the government to the court for this assertion was the decision of the  rail regulator  in 2002 to carry out an interim review of the company's finances, with the potential to advance significant additional sums to the company. [75]  The High Court accepted that the company was not insolvent, and the railway administration order was discharged in October 2002.\n Until 2013 there was discussion over whether Network Rail is a public-sector or a private-sector entity. Although it was officially a private sector organisation, the fact that its debts were underwritten by the government, and it is partly funded by the government, has led to its being described as being \"nationalisation in all but name\". [76]  It was also claimed that the government is keen for Network Rail not to be classified as a public-sector organisation, as this would mean that the company's debt would be counted as public expenditure liabilities. [77]  The  Office for National Statistics  (ONS) repeatedly clashed with the  National Audit Office  and the  Statistics Commission  over whether the successor to Railtrack should be considered a private company \u2013 as the ONS believed \u2013 or included on the Government's books, as the National Audit Office argued. The NAO said that as the Government is bearing the risk that would normally be borne by equity capital, and as it can appoint, through the SRA, a director who cannot be removed by members, Network Rail is effectively a subsidiary of the Government-controlled SRA. [78] [79] In December 2013 the ONS announced that from September 2014 Network Rail will be classified as a \"government body\". This resulted in the company's debt of \u00a334 billion being added to the  national debt [77] [80]  In the 2016\u201317 financial year Network Rail's net debt rose from \u00a341.6 billion to \u00a346.3 billion. [81] National Centre edit Main article:  Quadrant:MK The new national centre now known as 'The Quadrant:MK' is in  Milton Keynes : it completed construction in June 2012. [82]  The complex is five minutes' walk from  Milton Keynes Central . The four buildings, which are connected to a central street, accommodate about 3,000 people. As of June 2012 [update] , the engineering, logistics, operations including timetable planning, IT, procurement, planning and finance departments all planned to move to the Quadrant.

It is served by  London King's Cross railway station , the terminus of one of the major rail routes between London and the North. [3] The area has been regenerated since the mid-1990s with the terminus of the  Eurostar  rail service at  St Pancras International  opening in 2007 and the rebuilding of King's Cross station, a major redevelopment in the north of the area.\n Roof of King's Cross Contents 1 History 1.1 Toponymy 1.2 Railway stations 1.3 Post War Decline 1.4 Regeneration 1.5 Education, Culture & Heritage 2 In popular culture 3 Transport 4 Nearby attractions 5 References 6 External links History edit Toponymy edit The area was previously a village known as  Battle Bridge  or  Battlebridge  which was an ancient crossing of the  River Fleet . The original name of the bridge was Broad Ford Bridge. The  corruption  \"Battle Bridge\" led to a tradition that this was the site of a major battle in AD 60 or 61 between the  Romans  and the  Iceni  tribe led by  Boudica  (also known as Boudicea). [4]  The tradition claims support from the writing of  Publius Cornelius Tacitus , an ancient Roman historian, who described the place of action between the Romans and Boadicea ( Annals  14.31), but without specifying where it was; Thornbury addresses the pros and cons of the identification.  Lewis Spence 's 1937 book  Boadicea \u2013 warrior queen of the Britons  includes a map showing the supposed positions of the opposing armies. The suggestion that Boudica is buried beneath platform 9 or 10 at King's Cross station seems to have arisen as  urban folklore  since the end of  World War II [5]  The area had been settled in Roman times, and a camp here known as The Brill was erroneously attributed to  Julius Caesar , who never visited Londinium. [6]  There is still a small area named \"Battle Bridge Place\" between King's Cross and St Pancras stations, and \"Brill Place\", a road leading towards Euston from St Pancras Station. An art installation named the  Identified Flying Object  (IFO) stands in Battle Bridge Place, [7]  part of the RELAY King's Cross Arts programme. [8] St Pancras Old Church , also set behind the stations, is said to be one of the oldest Christian sites in Britain.\n The current name has its origin in  a monument  to  King George IV  which stood from 1830 to 1845 at \"the king's crossroads\" where New Road (later  Euston Road Gray's Inn Road , and  Pentonville Road  met. [9]  The monument was sixty feet high and topped by an eleven-foot-high statue of the king; it was described by  Walter Thornbury  as \"a ridiculous octagonal structure crowned by an absurd statue\". [4]  The statue itself, which cost no more than \u00a325, was constructed of bricks and mortar, and finished in a manner that gave it the appearance of stone \"at least to the eyes of common spectators\". [10]   The architect was  Stephen Geary [11]  who exhibited a model of \"the Kings Cross\" at the Royal Academy in 1830. [12]  The upper storey was used as a  camera obscura  while the base housed first a police station, and later a public house. The unpopular building was demolished in 1845, though the area kept the name of Kings Cross. [4]  A structure in the form of a  lighthouse  was built on top of a building almost on the site about 30 years later. Known locally as the \"Lighthouse Building\", the structure was popularly thought to be an advertisement for Netten's Oyster Bar on the ground floor, but this seems not to be true. [13]  It is a grade II listed building. [14] Railway stations edit King's Cross station now stands by the junction where the monument stood and took its name. [9]  The station, designed by architect  Lewis Cubitt  and opened in 1852, succeeded a temporary earlier station, erected north of the canal in time for the  Great Exhibition  of 1851.\n St Pancras railway station , built by the  Midland Railway , lies immediately to the west. They both had extensive land (\"the railway lands\") to house their associated facilities for handling general goods and specialist commodities such as fish, coal, potatoes and grain. The passenger stations on Euston Road far outweighed in public attention the economically more important goods traffic to the north. King's Cross and St Pancras stations, and indeed all London railway stations, made an important contribution to the capital's economy.\n Post War Decline edit Model showing the current redevelopment of the King's Cross area with the new  High Speed 1  terminal behind the barrel vaulted  St Pancras station  on the left. After World War II the area declined from being a poor but busy industrial and distribution services district to a partially abandoned post-industrial district. By the 1980s it was notorious for prostitution and drug abuse. [15]  This reputation impeded attempts to revive the area, utilising the large amount of land available following the decline of the railway goods yard to the north of the station and the many other vacant premises in the area.\n Relatively cheap rents and a central London location made the area attractive to artists and designers and both  Antony Gormley  and  Thomas Heatherwick  established studios in the area. In late 1980s, a group of musicians, mechanics, and squatters from Hammersmith called  Mutoid Waste Company  moved into Battlebridge Road warehouse. [16]  They built huge industrial sculptures out of scrap metal and held raves. In 1989 they were evicted by police. [17] \nIn 1992, the Community Creation Trust took over the disused coach repair depot and built it into the largest Ecology Centre in Europe with ecohousing for homeless youngsters, The Last Platform Cafe, London Ecology Centre (after its demise in Covent Garden), offices and workshops, gardens and ponds.  It was destroyed to make a car park for the Channel Tunnel Regeneration.  Bagley's Warehouse was a nightclub venue in the 1990s warehouse rave scene on the site of Goods Yard behind King's Cross stations, now part of the redevelopment area known as the Coal Drops adjacent to Granary Square.\n Regeneration edit Further information:  Kings Cross Central Kings Cross Post Office in Kings Cross, London. The site is one of the largest construction projects in Greater London in the first quarter of the 21st century. All of the \"socially undesirable\" behaviour has moved on, and new projects such as offices and housing are over halfway completed. \n In the 1990s, the government established the King's Cross Partnership [18]  to fund regeneration projects, and the commencement of work on  High Speed 1  in 2000 provided a major impetus for other projects. In 2001, Argent was selected as the development partner. The London terminus of the  Eurostar  international rail services to Paris and Brussels moved to St Pancras station in November 2007. \n Following the opening of the High Speed 1 to the station, redevelopment of the land between the two major stations and the old King's Cross railway lands to the rear commenced. In 2008, Argent, London & Continental Railways and DHL formed a joint partnership: Kings Cross Central Limited Partnership [19] . Outline planning permission, prepared by Allies and Morrison and Porphyrios Associates, was granted for the whole site in 2006. Detailed planning applications [20]  for each part of the site are being made on a rolling programme basis. \n The area remains a major focus of redevelopment in the second decade of the 21st century. In 2017, Google, which already occupy a large new building between St. Pancras and King's Cross stations, announced plans for a further \u00a31 billion building stretching along the west side of King's Cross station towards the Regents canal.\n The area has also been for many years home to a number of trades union head offices (including the NUJ, RMT, UNISON, NUT, Community and UCU).\n King\u2019s Cross in numbers: [21] \n67 acres, \n50 new buildings, \n1,900 new homes, \n20 new streets, \n10 new public parks and squares, \n26 acres of open space, \n30,000 people by 2016.\n Education, Culture & Heritage edit Battlebridge Basin The area has increasingly become home to cultural establishments. The  London Canal Museum  opened in 1992, [22]  and in 1997 a new home for the  British Library  opened next to St Pancras Station. There was a small theatre, the Courtyard, that closed in late 2006 as a result of the gentrification of the area caused by a number of regeneration projects there, in this case, Regent's Quarter, across the boundary in Islington. The  Gagosian Gallery  moved their main London premises to the area in 2004. [23]  The  London Sinfonietta  and the  Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment  are based in  King's Place , on  Battlebridge Basin  next to the  Regent's Canal . King's Place is also the home of  The Guardian  and  The Observer  newspapers, and of the UK Drug Policy Commission. \n In September 2011 the University of the Arts London moved to the Granary Complex. A whole series of new public squares and gardens have opened, among them Granary Square with its spectacular fountains, Lewis Cubitt Park and Square and the new Gasholder Park.\n The station's redevelopment led to the demolition of several buildings, including the Gasworks.

However, the author, JK Rowling, later admitted she mixed up Kings Cross with the next door station, Euston.  [25]  The railway station has put up a sign for the fictional \" Platform \u200b 9 3 4 \" described in the books, and embedded part of a luggage trolley halfway into the wall. Film adaptations have used platforms 4 and 5 for some scenes. [26] Kings Cross and its surrounding streets were also the setting for the 1955  Ealing comedy The Ladykillers [27]  two British drama films starring  Max Bygraves A Cry from the Streets  (1958) and  Spare the Rod  (1961)\u2014as well as  Mike Leigh 's  High Hopes  (1988). [15] Anthony Minghella 's 2006 film  Breaking and Entering  is also set in Kings Cross. [28] \"Vale Royal\", an epic poem in 700 triads by Aidan Andrew Dun probes into this zone of London; \"Vale Royal\" was launched at the Albert Hall in 1995. A triad of Dun's, excerpted from another poem, \"The Brill\", has been installed at the western end of Granary Square in a small grove of trees beside the new Central Saint Martins. It reads: \"Kings Cross, dense with angels and histories, there are cities beneath your pavements, cities behind your skies. Let me see!\"\n The  Irish rock  group  The Pogues  was founded in Kings Cross. [29] The British  pop music  duo  Pet Shop Boys  recorded a song featured on their 1987 album  Actually  named \"Kings Cross\": the melancholy track discusses the hopelessness of the AIDS epidemic during that time and uses the Kings Cross area as the \"backdrop\" of the story, trading on the area's associations with drug use and prostitution.  Tracey Thorn covered  the song in 2007. Songwriter  David Gedge  also wrote a song called \"Kings Cross\" while recording under the name  Cinerama Transport edit King's Cross and  St Pancras railway stations  are the principal  National Rail  services in the district. St Pancras is the  Eurostar  terminus for international services to  Amsterdam Brussels  and  Paris Thameslink  train line run underground northwards towards Kentish Town and Finsbury Park and southwards towards Farringdon (connection with Elisabeth  Crossrail  line) and Blackfriars.\n King's Cross St Pancras tube station  is a  London Underground  station underground in front of King's Cross railway station served by three sub surface lines sharing the same two platforms and three deep underground lines. \n Euston station , half a mile to the west, will from 2026/27 be the Central London terminus for the  High Speed 2  trainline towards  Old Oak Common  and Birmingham, and from the early 2030s towards Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds.\n The  One Belt One Road Initiative  may one day allow high speed passenger trains to reach Europe from China. The exact routes has not been determined.

A  geographic coordinate system  is a  coordinate system  that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters or symbols. [n 1]  The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a  vertical position  and two  or three  of the numbers represent a  horizontal position ; alternatively, a geographic position may be expressed in a combined  three-dimensional Cartesian vector .\nA common choice of coordinates is  latitude longitude  and  elevation [1] \nTo specify a location on a plane requires a  map projection [2] Contents 1 History 2 Geodetic datum 3 Horizontal coordinates 3.1 Latitude and longitude 3.1.1 Length of a degree 3.2 Map projection 3.2.1 UTM and UPS systems 3.2.2 Stereographic coordinate system 4 Vertical coordinates 5 3D Cartesian coordinates 5.1 Earth-centered, Earth-fixed 5.2 Local tangent plane 6 On other celestial bodies 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 9.1 Citations 9.2 Sources 10 External links History edit Main articles:  History of geodesy history of longitude , and  history of prime meridians The  invention  of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to  Eratosthenes  of  Cyrene , who composed his now-lost  Geography  at the  Library of Alexandria  in the 3rd century\u00a0BC. [3]  A century later,  Hipparchus  of  Nicaea  improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by timings of  lunar eclipses , rather than  dead reckoning . In the 1st or 2nd century,  Marinus  of  Tyre  compiled an extensive gazetteer and  mathematically-plotted world map  using coordinates measured east from a  prime meridian  at the westernmost known land, designated the  Fortunate Isles , off the coast of western Africa around the Canary or Cape Verde Islands, and measured north or south of the island of  Rhodes  off  Asia Minor Ptolemy  credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the  midsummer  day. [4] Ptolemy's 2nd-century  Geography  used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the  Equator  instead. After their work was translated into  Arabic  in the 9th century,  Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b 's  Book of the Description of the Earth  corrected Marinus' and Ptolemy's errors regarding the length of the  Mediterranean Sea [n 2]  causing  medieval Arabic cartography  to use a prime meridian around 10\u00b0 east of Ptolemy's line. Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following  Maximus Planudes ' recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated into  Latin  at  Florence  by  Jacobus Angelus  around 1407.\n In 1884, the  United States  hosted the  International Meridian Conference , attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the  Royal Observatory  in  Greenwich, England  as the zero-reference line. The  Dominican Republic  voted against the motion, while France and  Brazil  abstained. [5]  France adopted  Greenwich Mean Time  in place of local determinations by the  Paris Observatory  in 1911.\n Geodetic datum edit Main article:  Geodetic datum Further information:  Figure of the Earth Reference ellipsoid Geographic coordinate conversion , and  Spatial reference system In order to be unambiguous about the direction of \"vertical\" and the \"horizontal\" surface above which they are measuring, map-makers choose a  reference ellipsoid  with a given origin and orientation that best fits their need for the area they are mapping. They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference system or  geodetic datum Datums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be local, meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal  Earth tidal  movement caused by the  Moon  and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to  10 cm  a year, or  10 m  in a century. A  weather system  high-pressure area can cause a sinking of  5 mm Scandinavia  is rising by  1 cm  a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the  last ice age , but neighbouring  Scotland  is rising by only  0.2 cm . These changes are insignificant if a local datum is used, but are statistically significant if a global datum is used. [1] Examples of global datums include  World Geodetic System  (WGS 84), the default datum used for the  Global Positioning System [n 3]  and the  International Terrestrial Reference Frame  (ITRF), used for estimating  continental drift  and  crustal deformation [6]  The distance to Earth's center can be used both for very deep positions and for positions in space. [1] Local datums chosen by a national cartographical organisation include the  North American Datum , the European  ED50 , and the British  OSGB36 . Given a location, the datum provides the latitude  \u03d5 {\\displaystyle \\phi }  and longitude  \u03bb {\\displaystyle \\lambda } . In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude, longitude, and height systems in use. WGS 84 differs at Greenwich from the one used on published maps  OSGB36  by approximately 112 m. The military system  ED50 , used by  NATO , differs from about 120 m to 180 m. [1] The latitude and longitude on a map made against a local datum may not be the same as one obtained from a GPS receiver. Coordinates from the  mapping system  can sometimes be roughly changed into another datum using a simple  translation . For example, to convert from ETRF89 (GPS) to the  Irish Grid  add 49 meters to the east, and subtract 23.4 meters s from the north. [7]  More generally one datum is changed into any other datum using a process called  Helmert transformations . This involves converting the spherical coordinates into Cartesian coordinates and applying a seven parameter transformation (translation, three-dimensional  rotation ), and converting back. [1] In popular GIS software, data projected in latitude/longitude is often represented as a  Geographic Coordinate System . For example, data in latitude/longitude if the datum is the  North American Datum of 1983  is denoted by 'GCS North American 1983'.\n Horizontal coordinates edit Main article:  Horizontal position Latitude and longitude edit 0\u00b0 Equator, the 0\u00b0 parallel of latitude Main articles:  Latitude  and  Longitude The \"latitude\" (abbreviation: Lat.,  \u03c6 , or phi) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of the Earth. [n 4]  Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on the surface of Earth called  parallels , as they are parallel to the Equator and to each other. The  North Pole  is 90\u00b0\u00a0N; the  South Pole  is 90\u00b0\u00a0S. The 0\u00b0 parallel of latitude is designated the  Equator , the  fundamental plane  of all geographic coordinate systems. The Equator divides the globe into  Northern  and  Southern Hemispheres 0\u00b0 Prime Meridian, the 0\u00b0 of longitude The \"longitude\" (abbreviation: Long.,  \u03bb , or lambda) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference  meridian  to another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are halves of great  ellipses  (often called  great circles ), which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the  British Royal Observatory  in  Greenwich , in south-east London, England, is the international  prime meridian , although some organizations\u2014such as the French  Institut G\u00e9ographique National \u2014continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper  Eastern  and  Western Hemispheres , although maps often divide these hemispheres further west in order to keep the  Old World  on a single side. The  antipodal  meridian of Greenwich is both 180\u00b0W and 180\u00b0E. This is not to be conflated with the  International Date Line , which diverges from it in several places for political reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western  Aleutian Islands The combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of  altitude  or depth. The grid formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a \"graticule\". [8]  The origin/zero point of this system is located in the  Gulf of Guinea  about 625\u00a0km (390\u00a0mi) south of  Tema Ghana Length of a degree edit Main articles:  Length of a degree of latitude  and  Length of a degree of longitude This section  does not  cite  any  sources  Please help  improve this section  by  adding citations to reliable sources .

The circles of longitude, meridians, meet at the geographical poles, with the west-east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases. On the  Equator  at sea level, one longitudinal second measures 30.92\u00a0meters, a longitudinal minute is 1855\u00a0meters and a longitudinal degree is  111.3\u00a0kilometres. At 30\u00b0 a longitudinal second is 26.76\u00a0meters, at Greenwich (51\u00b028\u203238\u2033N) 19.22\u00a0meters, and at 60\u00b0 it is 15.42\u00a0meters. On the WGS84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude at latitude \u03c6 (that is, the distance along a north\u2013south line from latitude (\u03c6 \u2212 0.5) degrees to (\u03c6 + 0.5) degrees) is about\n 111132.92 559.82 cos 2 \u03c6 1.175 cos 4 \u03c6 0.0023 cos 6 \u03c6 {\\displaystyle 111132.92-559.82\\,\\cos 2\\varphi +1.175\\,\\cos 4\\varphi -0.0023\\,\\cos 6\\varphi } [9] Similarly, the length in meters of a degree of longitude can be calculated as\n 111412.84 cos \u03c6 93.5 cos 3 \u03c6 0.118 cos 5 \u03c6 {\\displaystyle 111412.84\\,\\cos \\varphi -93.5\\,\\cos 3\\varphi +0.118\\,\\cos 5\\varphi } [9] (Those coefficients can be improved, but as they stand the distance they give is correct within a centimetre.)\n An alternative method to estimate the length of a longitudinal degree at latitude  \u03c6 {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\varphi }\\,\\!}  is to assume a spherical Earth (to get the width per minute and second, divide by 60 and 3600, respectively):\n \u03c0 180 M r cos \u03c6 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\pi }{180}}M_{r}\\cos \\varphi \\!} where  Earth's average meridional radius M r {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {M_{r}}\\,\\!}  is  6,367,449 m . Since the Earth is not spherical that result can be off by several tenths of a percent; a better approximation of a longitudinal degree at latitude  \u03c6 {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\varphi }\\,\\!}  is\n \u03c0 180 a cos \u03b2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\pi }{180}}a\\cos \\beta \\,\\!} where Earth's equatorial radius  a {\\displaystyle a}  equals  6,378,137 m  and  tan \u03b2 b a tan \u03c6 {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\tan \\beta ={\\frac {b}{a}}\\tan \\varphi }\\,\\!} ; for the GRS80 and WGS84 spheroids, b/a calculates to be 0.99664719. ( \u03b2 {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\beta }\\,\\!}  is known as the  reduced (or parametric) latitude ). Aside from rounding, this is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude; getting the distance along the shortest route will be more work, but those two distances are always within 0.6 meter of each other if the two points are one degree of longitude apart.\n Longitudinal length equivalents at selected latitudes\n Latitude\n City\n Degree\n Minute\n Second\n \u00b10.0001\u00b0\n 60\u00b0\n Saint Petersburg 55.80\u00a0km\n 0.930\u00a0km\n 15.50\u00a0m\n 5.58\u00a0m\n 51\u00b0 28\u2032 38\u2033 N\n Greenwich 69.47\u00a0km\n 1.158\u00a0km\n 19.30\u00a0m\n 6.95\u00a0m\n 45\u00b0\n Bordeaux 78.85\u00a0km\n 1.31\u00a0km\n 21.90\u00a0m\n 7.89\u00a0m\n 30\u00b0\n New Orleans 96.49\u00a0km\n 1.61\u00a0km\n 26.80\u00a0m\n 9.65\u00a0m\n 0\u00b0\n Quito 111.3\u00a0km\n 1.855\u00a0km\n 30.92\u00a0m\n 11.13\u00a0m\n Map projection edit Main article:  Map projection To establish the position of a geographic location on a  map , a map projection is used to convert geodetic coordinates to plane coordinates on a map; it projects the datum ellipsoidal coordinates and height onto a flat surface of a map. The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of reference locations, establishes a  grid system  for plotting locations. Common map projections in current use include the  Universal Transverse Mercator  (UTM), the  Military Grid Reference System  (MGRS), the  United States National Grid  (USNG), the  Global Area Reference System  (GARS) and the  World Geographic Reference System  (GEOREF). [10] \nCoordinates on a map are usually in terms  northing  N and  easting  E offsets relative to a specified origin.\n Map projection formulas depend in the geometry of the projection as well as parameters dependent on the particular location at which the map is projected. The set of parameters can vary based on type of project and the conventions chosen for the projection. For the  transverse Mercator projection  used in UTM, the parameters associated are the latitude and longitude of the natural origin, the false northing and false easting, and an overall scale factor. [11]  Given the parameters associated with particular location or grin, the projection formulas for the transverse Mercator are a complex mix of algebraic and trigonometric functions. [11] 45-54 UTM and UPS systems edit Main articles:  Universal Transverse Mercator  and  Universal Polar Stereographic The  Universal Transverse Mercator  (UTM) and  Universal Polar Stereographic  (UPS) coordinate systems both use a metric-based Cartesian grid laid out on a  conformally projected  surface to locate positions on the surface of the Earth. The UTM system is not a single  map projection  but a series of sixty, each covering 6-degree bands of longitude. The UPS system is used for the polar regions, which are not covered by the UTM system.\n Stereographic coordinate system edit Further information:  Stereographic projection During medieval times, the stereographic coordinate system was used for navigation purposes. citation needed  The stereographic coordinate system was superseded by the latitude-longitude system. Although no longer used in navigation, the stereographic coordinate system is still used in modern times to describe crystallographic orientations in the fields of  crystallography mineralogy  and materials science. citation needed Vertical coordinates edit Main article:  Vertical position This section  needs expansion You can help by  adding to it December 2018 Vertical coordinates include height and depth.\n 3D Cartesian coordinates edit Further information:  Axes conventions Every point that is expressed in ellipsoidal coordinates can be expressed as an rectilinear  x y z Cartesian ) coordinate. Cartesian coordinates simplify many mathematical calculations. The Cartesian systems of different datums are not equivalent. [2] Earth-centered, Earth-fixed edit Earth centered, Earth fixed coordinates in relation to latitude and longitude. Main article:  ECEF The  Earth-centered Earth-fixed  (also known as the ECEF, ECF, or conventional terrestrial coordinate system) rotates with the Earth and has its origin at the center of the Earth.\n The conventional right-handed coordinate system puts:\n The origin at the center of mass of the Earth, a point close to the Earth's   center of figure The Z axis on the line between the North and South Poles, with positive values increasing northward (but does not exactly coincide with the Earth's rotational axis) [12] The X and Y axes in the plane of the Equator The X axis passing through extending from 180 degrees longitude at the Equator (negative) to 0 degrees longitude ( prime meridian ) at the Equator (positive) The Y axis passing through extending from 90 degrees west longitude at the Equator (negative) to 90 degrees east longitude at the Equator (positive) An example is the  NGS data  for a brass disk near Donner Summit, in California. Given the dimensions of the ellipsoid, the conversion from lat/lon/height-above-ellipsoid coordinates to X-Y-Z is straightforward\u2014calculate the X-Y-Z for the given lat-lon on the surface of the ellipsoid and add the X-Y-Z vector that is perpendicular to the ellipsoid there and has length equal to the point's height above the ellipsoid. The reverse conversion is harder: given X-Y-Z we can immediately get longitude, but no closed formula for latitude and height exists.  See \" Geodetic system .\" Using Bowring's formula in 1976  Survey Review  the first iteration gives latitude correct within 10 -11  degree as long as the point is within 10000 meters above or 5000 meters below the ellipsoid.\n Local tangent plane edit Earth centered Earth fixed and East, North, up coordinates. Main article:  Local tangent plane Further information:  Geographic coordinate conversion \u00a7\u00a0From ECEF to ENU A local tangent plane can be defined based on the  vertical and horizontal  dimensions. The  vertical coordinate  can point either up or down. There are two kinds of conventions for the frames:\n East, North, up (ENU), used in geography North, East, down (NED), used specially in aerospace In many targeting and tracking applications the local ENU Cartesian coordinate system is far more intuitive and practical than ECEF or geodetic coordinates. The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is sometimes known as a  local tangent  or  local geodetic  plane. By convention the east axis is labeled  x {\\displaystyle x} , the north  y {\\displaystyle y}  and the up  z {\\displaystyle z} In an airplane, most objects of interest are below the aircraft, so it is sensible to define down as a positive number. The NED coordinates allow this as an alternative to the ENU. By convention, the north axis is labeled  x {\\displaystyle x'} , the east  y {\\displaystyle y'}  and the down  z {\\displaystyle z'} . To avoid confusion between  x {\\displaystyle x}  and  x {\\displaystyle x'} , etc. in this article we will restrict the local coordinate frame to ENU.\n On other celestial bodies edit Similar coordinate systems are defined for other celestial bodies such as:\n A similarly well-defined system  based on the reference ellipsoid  for  Mars Selenographic coordinates  for the  Moon See also edit Atlas portal Decimal degrees Geodetic datum Geographic coordinate conversion Geographic information system Geographical distance Linear referencing Map projection Spatial reference systems Notes edit In specialized works, \"geographic coordinates\" are distinguished from other similar coordinate systems, such as geocentric coordinates and geodetic coordinates. See, for example, Sean E. Urban and P. Kenneth Seidelmann,  Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, 3rd. ed., (Mill Valley CA: University Science Books, 2013) p. 20\u201323. The pair had accurate absolute distances within the Mediterranean but underestimated the  circumference of the Earth , causing their degree measurements to overstate its length west from Rhodes or Alexandria, respectively. WGS 84 is the default datum used in most GPS equipment, but other datums can be selected. Alternative versions of latitude and longitude include geocentric coordinates, which measure with respect to Earth's center; geodetic coordinates, which model Earth as an  ellipsoid ; and geographic coordinates, which measure with respect to a plumb line at the location for which coordinates are given.

It is often called  British National Grid BNG [1] [2] The  Ordnance Survey  (OS) devised the national  grid reference  system, and it is heavily used in their survey data, and in maps based on those surveys, whether published by the Ordnance Survey or by commercial map producers. Grid references are also commonly quoted in other publications and data sources, such as guide books and government planning documents.\n A number of different systems exist that can provide grid references for locations within the  British Isles : this article describes the system created solely for Great Britain and its outlying islands (including the  Isle of Man ); the  Irish grid reference system  was a similar system created by the  Ordnance Survey of Ireland  and the  Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland  for the island of Ireland.  The  Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system  (UTM) is used to provide grid references for worldwide locations, and this is the system commonly used for the  Channel Islands  and Ireland ( since 2001 ). European-wide agencies also use UTM when mapping locations, or may use the  Military Grid Reference System  (MGRS) system, or variants of it. OSGB uses Orthorectified images of many temporal resolution for one area.\n Contents 1 General 1.1 Datum shift between OSGB 36 and WGS 84 1.2 Datum shift between OSGB 36 and ED 50 2 Grid letters 3 Grid digits 4 All-numeric grid references 5 Summary parameters of the coordinate system 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 9 External links General edit Grid square TF. The map shows  The Wash  and the  North Sea , as well as places within the counties of  Lincolnshire , Cambridgeshire and  Norfolk The grid is based on the  OSGB36 datum  (Ordnance Survey Great Britain 1936, citation needed  based on the  Airy  1830  ellipsoid citation needed  and was introduced after the  retriangulation of 1936\u20131962 citation needed  It replaced the previously used  Cassini Grid  which, citation needed  up to the end of  World War II , had been issued only to the military. citation needed The Airy ellipsoid is a regional best fit for Britain; more modern mapping tends to use the GRS80 ellipsoid used by the  Global Positioning System  (the Airy ellipsoid assumes the Earth to be about 1\u00a0km smaller in diameter than the GRS80 ellipsoid, and to be slightly less flattened). The British maps adopt a  transverse Mercator projection  with an origin (the \"true\" origin) at  49\u00b0\u00a0N 2\u00b0\u00a0W  (an offshore point in the  English Channel  which lies between the island of  Jersey  and the French port of  St. Malo [3]  Over the Airy ellipsoid a straight line grid, the National Grid, is placed with a new false origin to eliminate negative numbers, creating a 700\u00a0km by 1300\u00a0km grid. This false origin is located south-west of the Isles of Scilly.\n In order to minimize the overall scale error, a factor of 2499/2500 is applied. This creates two lines of longitude about 180\u00a0km east and west of the central meridian along which the local scale factor equals 1, i.e. map scale is correct. Inside these lines the local scale factor is less than 1, with a minimum of 0.04% too small at the central meridian [4] . Outside these lines the local scale factor is greater than 1, and is about 0.04% too large near the east and west coasts. Grid north and true north are only aligned on the central meridian (400\u00a0km easting) of the grid which is 2\u00b0\u00a0W (OSGB36) and approx.  2\u00b0 0\u2032 5\u2033 W WGS 84 OSGB 36 was also used by  Admiralty nautical charts  until 2000 citation needed  after which  WGS 84  has been used.\n A  geodetic  transformation between OSGB 36 and other terrestrial reference systems (like  ITRF2000 ETRS89 , or  WGS 84 ) can become quite tedious if attempted manually. The most common transformation is called the  Helmert datum transformation , which results in a typical 7\u00a0m error from true. The definitive transformation from ETRS89 that is published by the OSGB is called the National Grid Transformation OSTN15. [5]   This models the detailed distortions in the 1936\u20131962 retriangulation, and achieves backwards compatibility in grid coordinates to sub-metre accuracy.\n Datum shift between OSGB 36 and WGS 84 edit The difference between the coordinates on different datums varies from place to place. The  longitude  and  latitude  positions on OSGB 36 are the same as for  WGS 84  at a point in the Atlantic Ocean well to the west of Great Britain. In  Cornwall , the WGS 84 longitude  lines  are about 70 metres east of their OSGB 36 equivalents, this value rising gradually to about 120\u00a0m east on the east coast of  East Anglia . The WGS 84 latitude  lines  are about 70\u00a0m south of the OSGB 36 lines in South  Cornwall , the difference diminishing to zero in the  Scottish Borders , and then increasing to about 50\u00a0m north on the north coast of  Scotland . (If the  lines  are further  east , then the longitude  value  of any given point is further  west . Similarly, if the lines are further south, the values will give the point a more northerly latitude.) The smallest datum shift is on the west coast of Scotland and the greatest in  Kent Datum shift between OSGB 36 and ED 50 edit These two datums are not both in general use in any one place, but for a point in the  English Channel  halfway between  Dover  and  Calais , the  ED50  longitude lines are about 20\u00a0m east of the OSGB36 equivalents, and the ED50 latitude lines are about 150\u00a0m south of the OSGB36 ones. citation needed Illustration of the Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinate system, with  Trafalgar Square  as an example Grid letters edit For the first letter, the grid is divided into squares of size 500\u00a0km by 500\u00a0km, outlined in dark grey  on the map to the right. There are four of these which contain significant land area within Great Britain: S, T, N and H.  The O square contains a tiny area of  North Yorkshire , almost all of which lies below mean high tide. [6] For the second letter, each 500\u00a0km square is subdivided into 25 squares of size 100\u00a0km by 100\u00a0km, each with a letter code from A to Z (omitting I) starting with A in the north-west corner to Z in the south-east corner. These squares are outlined in light grey on the map, with those containing land lettered. The central (2\u00b0 W) meridian is shown in red.\n Grid digits edit Within each square,  eastings  and  northings  from the south west corner of the square are given numerically. For example, NH0325 means a 1\u00a0km square whose south-west corner is 3\u00a0km east and 25\u00a0km north from the south-west corner of square NH.  A location can be indicated to varying resolutions numerically, usually from two digits in each coordinate (for a 1\u00a0km square) through to five (for a 1\u00a0m square); in each case the first half of the digits is for the first coordinate and the second half for the other. The most common usage is the  six figure grid reference , employing three digits in each coordinate to determine a 100\u00a0m square. For example, the grid reference of the 100\u00a0m square containing the summit of  Ben Nevis  is  NN 166 712 .  (Grid references may be written with or without spaces; e.g., also NN166712.) NN has an easting of 200\u00a0km and northing of 700\u00a0km, so the OSGB36 National Grid location for Ben Nevis is at 216600, 771200.\n All-numeric grid references edit Grid references may also be quoted as a pair of numbers: eastings then northings in metres, measured from the southwest corner of the SV square. Note that 14 digits may be required for locations in  Orkney  and further north. For example, the grid reference for  Sullom Voe oil terminal  in the Shetland Islands may be given as  HU396753  or  439668,1175316 Another, distinct, form of all-numeric grid reference is an abbreviated alphanumeric reference where the letters are simply omitted, e.g. 166712 for the summit of Ben Nevis.  Unlike the numeric references described above, this abbreviated grid reference is incomplete; it gives the location relative to an OS 100\u00d7100\u00a0km\u00a0square, but does not specify which square. It is often used informally when the context identifies the OS 2-letter square.  For example, within the context of a location known to be on  OS Landranger sheet  41 (which extends from NN000500 in the south-west to NN400900 in the north-east) the abbreviated grid reference 166712 is equivalent to NN166712.  If working with more than one Landranger sheet, this may also be given as 41/166712.\n Alternatively, sometimes numbers instead of the two-letter combinations are used for the 100\u00d7100\u00a0km squares.  The numbering follows a grid index where the tens denote the progress from West to East and the units from South to North.  In the north of Scotland, the numbering is modified: the 100\u00a0km square to the north of 39 is numbered N30; the square to the north of 49 is N40, etc.\n Summary parameters of the coordinate system edit Datum : OSGB36 Map projection Transverse Mercator projection  using  Redfearn series True Origin 49\u00b0N 2\u00b0W False Origin : 400 km west, 100 km north of True Origin Scale Factor : 0.9996012717+ [7] EPSG  Code: EPSG:27700 Ellipsoid : Airy 1830 [8] Semi-major axis  a:  6 377 563.396 \u00a0m Semi-minor axis  b:  6 356 256.909 \u00a0m Flattening  (derived constant): 1/299.3249646 See also edit World Geodetic System Irish grid reference system United States National Grid Tetrad Hectad Myriad International Map of the World#Map Indexing System Notes edit \"OSGB 1936 / British National Grid: EPSG Projection  -- Spatial Reference\" spatialreference.org .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em} \"Coordinate systems and projections for beginners\" OS Net, The true origin Ordnance Survey (1946) p. 4 \"Surveying guidelines\" .

In 2006, two Green Cllrs, Maya de Souza and Adrian Oliver, were elected (to Highgate Ward) and were the first Green Party councillors in Camden. In 1985 when the borough was  rate-capped , the Labour leadership joined the  rebellion  in which it declared its inability to set a budget in an unsuccessful attempt to force the Government to allow higher spending. Camden was the fourth to last council to drop out of the campaign, doing so in the early hours of 6 June.\n Borough councillors are elected every four years. Since May 2002 the electoral wards in Camden are  Belsize Bloomsbury Camden Town with Primrose Hill Cantelowes Fortune Green Frognal and Fitzjohns Gospel Oak Hampstead Town Haverstock Highgate Holborn and Covent Garden Kentish Town Kilburn King's Cross Regent's Park St Pancras and Somers Town Swiss Cottage  and  West Hampstead Between 2006 and 2010 Labour lost two seats to the Liberal Democrats through by-elections, in Kentish Town and Haverstock wards. A Labour Councillor in Haverstock ward also defected to the Liberal Democrats in February 2009. The Conservatives also lost two seats, one to the Liberal Democrats in Hampstead, and one to the  Green Party , Alexander Goodman, in Highgate, taking the total number of Green Party Councillors to three.  At the  local elections on 6 May 2010  the  Labour party  regained full control of Camden council.\n The organisation's staff are led by the  Chief Executive  who is currently Mike Cooke. The organisation is divided into five directorates:\n Housing and Adult Social Care Children, Schools and Families Culture & Environment Central Services:\n Finance Legal Strategy and Organisation Development Chief Executives Department The directorates are headed by a director who reports directly to the Chief Executive. Each directorate is divided into a number of  divisions  headed by an assistant director. They, in turn, are divided into  groups  which are themselves divided into  services . This is a similar model to most local government in London.\n London Assembly edit Camden forms part of the  Barnet and Camden  London Assembly constituency, represented by  Andrew Dismore  of the Labour Party\n UK Parliament edit There are two parliamentary constituencies covering Camden:  Hampstead and Kilburn  in the north, represented by Labour's  Tulip Siddiq , and  Holborn and St. Pancras  in the south, represented by Labour's  Keir Starmer Demographics edit Population Year Pop. 1801  96,795 1811  124,741 +28.9% 1821  158,077 +26.7% 1831  192,228 +21.6% 1841  228,950 +19.1% 1851  270,197 +18.0% 1861  301,408 +11.6% 1871  332,619 +10.4% 1881  363,830 +9.4% 1891  376,500 +3.5% 1901  362,581 \u22123.7% 1911  349,184 \u22123.7% 1921  335,408 \u22123.9% 1931  322,212 \u22123.9% 1941  286,956 \u221210.9% 1951  255,558 \u221210.9% 1961  231,143 \u22129.6% 1971  209,097 \u22129.5% 1981  161,100 \u221223.0% 1991  181,489 +12.7% 2001  198,027 +9.1% 2011  220,338 +11.3% Source:  A Vision of Britain through time In 1801, the  civil parishes  that form the modern borough were already developed and had a total population of 96,795. This continued to rise swiftly throughout the 19th century as the district became built up, reaching 270,197 in the middle of the century. When the railways arrived the rate of  population growth  slowed, for while many people were drawn in by new employment, others were made homeless by the new central London termini and construction of lines through the district. The population peaked at 376,500 in the 1890s, after which official efforts began to clear the overcrowded  slums  around  St Pancras  and  Holborn After  World War II , further suburban public housing was built to rehouse the many Londoners made homeless in  the Blitz , and there was an exodus from London towards the  new towns  under the  Abercrombie Plan for London  (1944). As industry declined during the 1970s the population continued to decline, falling to 161,100 at the start of the 1980s. It has now begun to rise again with new housing developments on brownfield sites and the release of railway and gas work lands around  Kings Cross . A 2017 study found that the eviction rate of 6 per 1,000 renting households in Camden is the lowest rate in London. [9] The  2001 census  gave Camden a population of 198,000, an undercount that was later revised to 202,600. [10]  The projected 2006 figure is 227,500.\n On 20 May 1999, the  Camden New Journal  newspaper documented 'Two Camdens' syndrome as a high-profile phenomenon differentiating the characteristics of education services in its constituencies. In 2006, Dame Julia Neuberger's book reported similar variation as a characteristic of Camden's children's health services. Her insider's view was corroboration \u2013 in addition to the 2001 \"Inequalities\" report by Director of Public Health Dr. Maggie Barker of \"stark contrasts in\" health and education opportunities \u2013 of earlier similar Audit Commission findings and a verification/update of the 1999 CNJ report.

other uses, see  Metropolitan railway (disambiguation) Montage of the Metropolitan Railway's stations from  Illustrated London News  December 1862, the month before the railway opened The  Metropolitan Railway  (also known as the  Met [note 1]  was a passenger and goods railway that served  London  from 1863 to 1933, its main line heading north-west from the capital's financial heart in  the City  to what were to become the  Middlesex  suburbs. Its first line connected the main-line  railway termini  at  Paddington Euston , and  King's Cross  to the City. The first section was built beneath the  New Road  using the \" cut-and-cover \" method between Paddington and King's Cross and in tunnel and cuttings beside  Farringdon Road  from King's Cross to near  Smithfield , near the City. It opened to the public on 10 January 1863 with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives, the world's first passenger-carrying designated underground railway. [2] The line was soon extended from both ends, and northwards via a branch from  Baker Street . Southern branches, directly served, reached  Hammersmith  in 1864,  Richmond  in 1877 and the original completed the  Inner Circle  in 1884, but the most important routes were those north-west into Middlesex countryside, stimulating the development of new suburbs.  Harrow  was reached in 1880, and from 1897 having achieved the early patronage of the  Duke of Buckingham  and owners of  Waddesdon Manor  services extended for many years to  Verney Junction , beyond  Aylesbury , in  Buckinghamshire , as the crow flies 46 miles (74 kilometres) from Baker Street, still further from the City of London beyond.\n Electric traction was introduced in 1905 and by 1907  electric multiple units  operated most of the services, though electrification of outlying sections did not occur until decades later. Unlike other railway companies in the London area, the Met developed land for housing, and after World War I promoted housing estates near the railway using the \" Metro-land \" brand. On 1 July 1933, the Met was amalgamated with the  Underground Electric Railways Company of London  and the capital's tramway and bus operators to form the  London Passenger Transport Board Former Met tracks and stations are used by the  London Underground 's  Metropolitan Circle District Hammersmith & City Piccadilly Jubilee  and  Victoria  lines, and by  Chiltern Railways  and  Great Northern Contents 1 History 1.1 Paddington to the City, 1853\u201363 1.1.1 Establishment 1.1.2 Construction 1.1.3 Opening 1.2 Extensions and the Inner Circle, 1863\u201384 1.2.1 Farringdon to Moorgate and the City Widened Lines 1.2.2 Hammersmith & City Railway 1.2.3 Inner Circle 1.3 Extension Line, 1868\u201399 1.3.1 Baker Street to Harrow 1.3.2 Harrow to Verney Junction, Brill Branch and Wembley Park Station 1.3.3 Great Central Railway 1.4 Electrification, 1900\u201314 1.4.1 Development 1.4.2 Running electric trains 1.4.3 London Underground 1.4.4 East London Railway 1.4.5 Great Northern & City Railway 1.5 War and \"Metro-land\", 1914\u201332 1.5.1 World War I 1.5.2 Metro-land development 1.5.3 Infrastructure improvements 1.6 London Passenger Transport Board, 1933 1.7 Legacy 2 Accident 3 Goods 4 Rolling stock 4.1 Steam locomotives 4.2 Carriages 4.3 Electric locomotives 4.4 Electric multiple units 5 Notes 6 References 6.1 Citations 6.2 Sources 7 External links History edit Paddington to the City, 1853\u201363 edit Establishment edit Charles Pearson , promoter of underground railways for London In the first half of the 19th century the population and physical extent of London grew greatly. [note 2]  The increasing resident population and the development of a commuting population arriving by train each day led to a high level of traffic congestion with huge numbers of carts, cabs, and omnibuses filling the roads and up to 200,000 people entering the  City of London , the commercial heart, each day on foot. [4]  By 1850 there were seven railway termini around the urban centre of London:  London Bridge  and  Waterloo  to the south,  Shoreditch  and  Fenchurch Street  to the east,  Euston  and  King's Cross  to the north, and  Paddington  to the west. Only Fenchurch Street station was within the City. [5] The congested streets and the distance to the City from the stations to the north and west prompted many attempts to get parliamentary approval to build new railway lines into the City. None were successful, and the 1846  Royal Commission  investigation into Metropolitan Railway Termini banned construction of new lines or stations in the built-up central area. [6] [7] [note 3]  The concept of an underground railway linking the City with the mainline termini was first proposed in the 1830s.  Charles Pearson , Solicitor to the City, was a leading promoter of several schemes and in 1846 proposed a central railway station to be used by multiple railway companies. [8]  The scheme was rejected by the 1846 commission, but Pearson returned to the idea in 1852 when he helped set up the City Terminus Company to build a railway from Farringdon to King's Cross. The plan was supported by the City, but the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed. [9] The Bayswater, Paddington, and Holborn Bridge Railway Company was established to connect the  Great Western Railway 's (GWR's) Paddington station to Pearson's route at King's Cross. [9] [note 4]  A  bill  was published in November 1852 [10]  and in January 1853 the directors held their first meeting and appointed  John Fowler  as its engineer. [11]  After successful lobbying, the company secured parliamentary approval under the name of the \"North Metropolitan Railway\" in mid-1853. The bill submitted by the City Terminus Company was rejected by Parliament, which meant that the North Metropolitan Railway would not be able to reach the City: to overcome this obstacle, the company took over the City Terminus Company and submitted a new bill in November 1853. This dropped the City terminus and extended the route south from Farringdon to the  General Post Office  in  St. Martin's Le Grand . The route at the western end was also altered so that it connected more directly to the GWR station. Permission was sought to connect to the  London and North Western Railway  (LNWR) at Euston and to the  Great Northern Railway  (GNR) at King's Cross, the latter by hoists and lifts. [12]  The company's name was also to be changed again, to Metropolitan Railway. [9] [13] Royal assent  was granted to the  North Metropolitan Railway Act  on 7 August 1854. [12] [14] Construction of the Metropolitan Railway close to King's Cross station in 1861 Construction of the railway was estimated to cost \u00a31\u00a0million. [note 5]  Initially, with the  Crimean War  under way, the Met found it hard to raise the capital. [9]  While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new bills to Parliament seeking an extension of time to carry out the works. [12] [note 6]  In July 1855, an Act to make a direct connection to the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the  Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act  and in 1860 by the  Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act [12] The GWR agreed to contribute \u00a3175,000 [note 7]  and a similar sum was promised by the GNR, but sufficient funds to make a start on construction had not been raised by the end of 1857. Costs were reduced by cutting back part of the route at the western end so that it did not connect directly to the GWR station, and by dropping the line south of Farringdon. [15] [note 8]  In 1858, Pearson arranged a deal between the Met and the City of London Corporation whereby the Met bought land it needed around the new  Farringdon Road  from the City for \u00a3179,000 and the City purchased \u00a3200,000 worth of shares. [17] [note 9]  The route changes were approved by Parliament in August 1859, meaning that the Met finally had the funding to match its obligations and construction could begin. [18] Construction edit The Metropolitan Railway's cutting at Farringdon following the flooding from the Fleet sewer in June 1862 Despite concerns about undermining and vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings [19]  and compensating the thousands of people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel [20]  construction began in March 1860. [16]  The line was mostly built using the \" cut-and-cover \" method from Paddington to King's Cross; east of there it continued in a 728 yards (666\u00a0m) tunnel under Mount Pleasant,  Clerkenwell  then followed the culverted  River Fleet  beside Farringdon Road in an open cutting to near the new  meat market  at Smithfield. [21] [22] The trench was 33\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (10.2\u00a0m) wide, with brick  retaining walls  supporting an  elliptical  brick arch or iron girders spanning 28\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (8.7\u00a0m). [23]  The tunnels were wider at stations to accommodate the platforms. Most of the excavation work was carried out manually by  navvies ; a primitive earth-moving  conveyor  was used to remove excavated spoil from the trench. [24] [note 10] Within the tunnel, two lines were laid with a 6-foot (1.8\u00a0m) gap between. To accommodate both the  standard gauge  trains of the GNR and the  broad gauge  trains of the GWR, the track was three-rail  mixed gauge , the rail nearest the platforms being shared by both gauges. [16]  Signalling was on the  absolute block  method, using electric  Spagnoletti  block instruments and fixed signals. [25] Construction was not without incident. In May 1860, a GNR train overshot the platform at King's Cross and fell into the workings. Later in 1860, a  boiler explosion  on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed the driver and his assistant. In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the  Metropolitan Board of Works  managed to stem and divert the water and the construction was delayed by only a few months. [26] Trial runs were carried out from November 1861 while construction was still under way. The first trip over the whole line was in May 1862 with  William Gladstone  among the guests. [27]  By the end of 1862 work was complete at a cost of \u00a31.3 million. [28] [note 11] Opening edit Board of Trade  inspections took place in late December 1862 and early January 1863 to approve the railway for opening. [30]  After minor signalling changes were made, approval was granted and a few days of operating trials were carried out before the grand opening on 9 January 1863, which included a ceremonial run from Paddington and a large banquet for 600 shareholders and guests at Farringdon. [30]  Charles Pearson did not live to see the completion of the project; he died in September 1862. [31] The railway as it opened in 1863 The 3.75-mile (6\u00a0km) railway opened to the public on Saturday 10 January 1863. [29]  There were stations at Paddington (Bishop's Road) (now  Paddington Edgware Road Baker Street , Portland Road (now  Great Portland Street ), Gower Street (now  Euston Square ), King's Cross (now  King's Cross St Pancras ), and Farringdon Street (now  Farringdon [32] The railway was hailed a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, using GNR trains to supplement the service. [33]  In the first 12 months 9.5\u00a0million passengers were carried [22]  and in the second 12 months this increased to 12\u00a0million. [34] The original timetable allowed 18 minutes for the journey. Off-peak service frequency was every 15 minutes, increased to ten minutes during the morning peak and reduced 20 minutes in the early mornings and after 8\u00a0pm. From May 1864, workmen's returns were offered on the 5:30\u00a0am and 5:40\u00a0am services from Paddington at the cost of a single ticket (3 d [35] Initially the railway was worked by GWR broad-gauge  Metropolitan Class  steam locomotives and rolling stock. Soon after the opening disagreement arose between the Met and the GWR over the need to increase the frequency, and the GWR withdrew its stock in August 1863. The Met continued operating a reduced service using GNR standard-gauge rolling stock before purchasing its own standard-gauge locomotives from  Beyer, Peacock  and rolling stock. [31] [36] [note 12] The Metropolitan initially ordered 18 tank locomotives, of which a key feature was condensing equipment which prevented most of the steam from escaping while trains were in tunnels; they have been described as \"beautiful little engines, painted green and distinguished particularly by their enormous external cylinders.\" [38]  The design proved so successful that eventually 120 were built to provide traction on the Metropolitan, the  District Railway  (in 1871) and all other 'cut and cover' underground lines. [38]  This 4-4-0 tank engine can therefore be considered as the pioneer motive power on London's first underground railway; [39]  ultimately, 148 were built between 1864 and 1886 for various railways, and most kept running until electrification in 1905.\n In the belief that it would be operated by smokeless locomotives, the line had been built with little ventilation and a long tunnel between Edgware Road and King's Cross. [40]  Initially the smoke-filled stations and carriages did not deter passengers [41]  and the ventilation was later improved by making an opening in the tunnel between Gower Street and King's Cross and removing glazing in the station roofs. [42]  With the problem continuing after the 1880s, conflict arose between the Met, who wished to make more openings in the tunnels, and the local authorities, who argued that these would frighten horses and reduce property values. [43]  This led to an 1897 Board of Trade report, [note 13]  which reported that a pharmacist was treating people in distress after having travelled on the railway with his 'Metropolitan Mixture'. The report recommended more openings be authorised but the line was electrified before these were built. [43] Extensions and the Inner Circle, 1863\u201384 edit Farringdon to Moorgate and the City Widened Lines edit Main article:  City Widened Lines The City Widened Lines between King's Cross and Moorgate Street and their connections. The east curve south to the LC&DR opened in 1871, the station at Snow Hill was opened in 1874. With connections to the GWR and GNR under construction and connections to the  Midland Railway  and  London, Chatham and Dover Railway  (LC&DR) planned, the Met obtained permission in 1861 and 1864 [note 14]  for two additional tracks from King's Cross to Farringdon Street and a four-track eastward extension to  Moorgate [45] [46] [47]  The Met used two tracks: the other two tracks, the City Widened Lines, used mainly by other railway companies. [48] A pair of single-track tunnels at King's Cross connecting the GNR to the Met opened on 1 October 1863 when the GNR began running services, [49] [note 15]  the GWR returning the same day with through suburban trains from such places as Windsor. [50]  By 1864 the Met had sufficient carriages and locomotives to run its own trains and increase the frequency to six trains an hour. [51] On 1 January 1866, LC&DR and GNR joint services from  Blackfriars Bridge  began operating via the  Snow Hill tunnel  under Smithfield market to Farringdon and northwards to the GNR. [52]  The extension to Aldersgate Street and Moorgate Street (now  Barbican  and  Moorgate ) had opened on 23 December 1865 [53]  and all four tracks were open on 1 March 1866. [54] The new tracks from King's Cross to Farringdon were first used by a GNR freight train on 27 January 1868. The Midland Railway junction opened on 13 July 1868 when services ran into Moorgate Street before its St Pancras terminus had opened. The line left the main line at St Paul's Road Junction, entering a double-track tunnel and joining the Widened Lines at Midland Junction. [55] Hammersmith & City Railway edit The Metropolitan Railway in 1873, ten years after opening. Also shown is the Metropolitan and St John's Wood Railway from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage, which was operated by the Metropolitan Railway. The GWR operated the services between Kensington (Addison Road) and Moorgate. In November 1860, a bill was presented to Parliament, [note 16]  supported by the Met and the GWR, for a railway from the GWR's main line a mile west of Paddington to the developing suburbs of  Shepherd's Bush  and  Hammersmith , with a connection to the  West London Railway  at Latimer Road. [57] [58]  Authorised on 22 July 1861 as the Hammersmith and City Railway (H&CR), [59]  the 2\u00a0miles 35\u00a0chains (3.9\u00a0km) line, constructed on a 20-foot (6.1\u00a0m) high viaduct largely across open fields, [60]  opened on 13 June 1864 with a broad-gauge GWR service from Farringdon Street,  [61]  with stations at Notting Hill (now  Ladbroke Grove ), Shepherd's Bush (replaced by the current  Shepherd's Bush Market  in 1914) and  Hammersmith [32]  The link to the West London Railway opened on 1 July that year, served by a carriage that was attached or detached at Notting Hill for  Kensington (Addison Road) [61]  Following an agreement between the Met and the GWR, from 1865 the Met ran a standard-gauge service to Hammersmith and the GWR a broad-gauge service to Kensington. In 1867, the H&CR became jointly owned by the two companies. The GWR began running standard-gauge trains and the broad gauge rail was removed from the H&CR and the Met in 1869. In 1871, two additional tracks parallel to the GWR between Westbourne Park and Paddington were brought into use for the H&CR and in 1878 the flat crossing at Westbourne Park was replaced by a  diveunder [60]  In August 1872, the GWR Addison Road service was extended over the  District Railway  via Earl's Court to  Mansion House . This became known as the  Middle Circle  and ran until January 1905; from 1 July 1900 trains terminated at Earl's Court. [62]  Additional stations were opened at  Westbourne Park  (1866),  Latimer Road  (1868),  Royal Oak  (1871),  Wood Lane  (1908) and  Goldhawk Road  (1914).\n Between 1 October 1877 and 31 December 1906 some services on the H&CR were extended to  Richmond  over the  London and South Western Railway  (L&SWR) via its station at  Hammersmith (Grove Road) [63] [note 17] Inner Circle edit The early success of the Met prompted a flurry of applications to Parliament in 1863 for new railways in London, many of them competing for similar routes. To consider the best proposals, the  House of Lords  established a  select committee , which issued a report in July 1863 with a recommendation for an \"inner circuit of railway that should abut, if not actually join, nearly all of the principal railway termini in the Metropolis\". A number of railway schemes were presented for the 1864 parliamentary session that met the recommendation in varying ways and a  Joint Committee of the Parliament of the United Kingdom  was set up to review the options. [64] [note 18] Proposals from the Met to extend south from Paddington to  South Kensington  and east from Moorgate to  Tower Hill  were accepted and received royal assent on 29 July 1864. [66]  To complete the circuit, the committee encouraged the amalgamation of two schemes via different routes between Kensington and the City, and a combined proposal under the name  Metropolitan District Railway  (commonly known as the District railway) was agreed on the same day. [66] [67] [note 19] \nInitially, the District and the Met were closely associated and it was intended that they would soon merge. The Met's chairman and three other directors were on the board of the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the construction works for all of the extensions were let as a single contract. [68] [69]  The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met. [68] A GWR broad gauge train is taking the route to Bishop's Road at Praed Street junction near Paddington, where the Notting Hill and Brompton extension joins the original line. Starting as a branch from Praed Street junction, a short distance east of the Met's Paddington station, the western extension passed through fashionable districts in  Bayswater Notting Hill , and  Kensington . Land values here were higher and, unlike the original line, the route did not follow an easy alignment under existing roads. Compensation payments for property were much higher. In  Leinster Gardens , Bayswater, a fa\u00e7ade of two five-storey houses was built at Nos. 23 and 24 to conceal the gap in a terrace created by the railway passing through. To ensure adequate ventilation, most of the line was in cutting except for a 421-yard (385\u00a0m) tunnel under  Campden Hill [70]  Construction of the District proceeded in parallel with the work on the Met and it too passed through expensive areas. Construction costs and compensation payments were so high that the cost of the first section of the District from South Kensington to  Westminster  was \u00a33 million, almost three times as much as the Met's original, longer line. [71] The first section of the Met extension opened to  Brompton  (Gloucester Road) (now  Gloucester Road ) on 1 October 1868, [68]  with stations at Paddington (Praed Street) (now  Paddington Bayswater Notting Hill Gate , and Kensington (High Street) (now  High Street Kensington [32]  Three months later, on 24 December 1868, the Met extended eastwards to a shared station at  South Kensington  and the District opened its line from there to Westminster, with other stations at  Sloane Square Victoria St James's Park , and Westminster Bridge (now  Westminster [32] The District also had parliamentary permission to extend westward from Brompton and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a single-track line to  West Brompton  on the WLR. There were no intermediate stations and at first this service operated as a shuttle from Gloucester Road. [72] [73]  By mid-1869 separate tracks had been laid between South Kensington and Brompton and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction with the line to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed  Cromwell curve  connecting Brompton and Kensington (High Street). [74] East of Westminster, the next section of the District's line ran in the new  Victoria Embankment  built by the  Metropolitan Board of Works  along the north bank of the  River Thames . The line opened from Westminster to Blackfriars on 30 May 1870 [72]  with stations at Charing Cross (now  Embankment ), The Temple (now  Temple ) and  Blackfriars [32] On its opening the Met operated the trains on the District, receiving 55 per cent of the gross receipts for a fixed level of service. Extra trains required by the District were charged for and the District's share of the income dropped to about 40 per cent. The District's level of debt meant that the merger was no longer attractive to the Met and did not proceed, so the Met's directors resigned from the District's board. To improve its finances, the District gave the Met notice to terminate the operating agreement. Struggling under the burden of its very high construction costs, the District was unable to continue with the remainder of the original scheme to reach Tower Hill and made a final extension of its line just one station east from Blackfriars to a previously unplanned City terminus at  Mansion House [75] [76] In 1871 the  inner circle  services began, starting from Mansion House and travelling to Moorgate Street via South Kensington and Paddington. The companies had their own pairs of track between Kensington High Street and South Kensington. On Saturday 1 July 1871 an opening banquet was attended by  Prime Minister William Gladstone , who was also a shareholder. The following Monday, Mansion House opened and the District began running its own trains. [77]  From this date, the two companies operated a joint  Inner Circle  service between Mansion House and Moorgate Street via South Kensington and Edgware Road every ten minutes, [note 20]  supplemented by a District service every ten minutes between Mansion House and West Brompton and H&CR and GWR suburban services between Edgware Road and Moorgate Street. [78]  The permissions for the railway east of Mansion House were allowed to lapse. [79]  At the other end of the line, the District part of South Kensington station opened on 10 July 1871  [80] [note 21]  and  Earl's Court  station opened on the West Brompton extension on 30 October 1871. [32] In 1868 and 1869, judgements went against the Met in a number of hearings, finding financial irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. [82]  They all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for a much lower amount, [83]  but to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and  Edward Watkin  appointed chairman. [84]  Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the  South Eastern Railway  (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway. [85] [note 22] Due to the cost of land purchases, the Met's eastward extension from Moorgate Street was slow to progress and it had to obtain an extension of the Act's time limit in 1869. The extension was begun in 1873, but after construction exposed burials in the vault of a Roman Catholic chapel, the contractor reported that it was difficult to keep the men at work. The first section opened to the  Great Eastern Railway 's (GER's) recently opened terminus at  Liverpool Street  on 1 February 1875. For a short time, while the Met's station was being built, services ran into the GER station via a 3.5-chain (70\u00a0m) curve, the Met opening its station later that year on 12 July and this curve not being used again by regular traffic. During the extension of the railway to  Aldgate  several hundred cartloads of bullocks' horn were discovered in a layer 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) below the surface. A terminus opened at Aldgate on 18 November 1876, initially for a shuttle service to Bishopsgate before all Met and District trains worked through from 4 December. [88] The joint line (shown in blue) that completed the inner circle in 1884 and gave the Met and District access to the East London Railway. The Met's station at the Tower of London was closed soon after the line was opened. District services were extended east of Whitechapel over the  Whitechapel & Bow Railway  in 1902. [89] Conflict between the Met and the District and the expense of construction delayed further progress on the completion of the inner circle. In 1874, frustrated City financiers formed the  Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion Railway Company  with the aim of finishing the route. This company was supported by the District and obtained parliamentary authority on 7 August 1874. [90] [91]  The company struggled to raise the funding and an extension of time was granted in 1876. [90]  A meeting between the Met and the District was held in 1877 with the Met now wishing to access the SER via the  East London Railway  (ELR). Both companies promoted and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1879 for the extension and link to the ELR, the Act also ensuring future co-operation by allowing both companies access to the whole circle. [note 23]  A large contribution was made by authorities for substantial road and sewer improvements. In 1882, the Met extended its line from Aldgate to a temporary station at  Tower of London [93]  Two contracts to build joint lines were placed, from Mansion House to the Tower in 1882 and from the circle north of Aldgate to Whitechapel with a curve onto the ELR in 1883. From 1 October 1884, the District and the Met began working trains from  St Mary's  via this curve onto the ELR to the SER's  New Cross station [94] [note 24]  After an official opening ceremony on 17 September and trial running a circular service started on Monday 6 October 1884. On the same day the Met extended some H&CR services over the ELR to New Cross, calling at new joint stations at  Aldgate East  and St Mary's. [94] [32]  Joint stations opened on the circle line at  Cannon Street , Eastcheap ( Monument  from 1 November 1884) and  Mark Lane . The Met's Tower of London station closed on 12 October 1884 after the District refused to sell tickets to the station. [95]  Initially, the service was eight trains an hour, completing the 13 miles (21 kilometres) circle in 81\u201384 minutes, but this proved impossible to maintain and was reduced to six trains an hour with a 70-minute timing in 1885. Guards were permitted no relief breaks during their shift until September 1885, when they were permitted three 20-minute breaks.

[97] [98]  There were intermediate stations at  St John's Wood Road  and  Marlborough Road , both with crossing loops, and the line was worked by the Met with a train every 20 minutes. A junction was built with the Inner Circle at Baker Street, but there were no through trains after 1869. [99] The original intention of the Metropolitan & St. John's Wood Railway was to run to underground north-east to  Hampstead Village , and indeed this appeared on some maps. [100]  This was not completed in full and the line was built in a north-western direction instead; a short heading of tunnel was built north of Swiss Cottage station in the direction of Hampstead. [101]  This is still visible today when travelling on a southbound Metropolitan line service.\n In the early 1870s, passenger numbers were low and the M&SJWR was looking to extend the line to generate new traffic. Recently placed in charge of the Met, Watkin saw this as the priority as the cost of construction would be lower than in built-up areas and fares higher; traffic would also be fed into the Circle. [102] [103]  In 1873, the M&SJWR was given authority to reach the Middlesex countryside at Neasden, [104] [note 25]  but as the nearest inhabited place to Neasden was Harrow it was decided to build the line 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km) further to Harrow [105]  and permission was granted in 1874. [104] [note 26]  To serve the  Royal Agricultural Society 's 1879 show at Kilburn, a single line to  West Hampstead  opened on 30 June 1879 with a temporary platform at  Finchley Road . Double track and a full service to  Willesden Green  started on 24 November 1879 with a station at Kilburn & Brondesbury (now  Kilburn [106]  The line was extended 5\u00a0miles 37.5\u00a0chains (8.80\u00a0km) to  Harrow , the service from Baker Street beginning on 2 August 1880. The intermediate station at Kingsbury Neasden (now  Neasden ) was opened the same day. [107]  Two years later, the single-track tunnel between Baker Street and Swiss Cottage was duplicated and the M&SJWR was absorbed by the Met. [108] In 1882, the Met moved its carriage works from Edgware Road to Neasden. [109]  A locomotive works was opened in 1883 and a gas works in 1884. To accommodate employees moving from London over 100 cottages and ten shops were built for rent. In 1883, a school room and church took over two of the shops; two years later land was given to the  Wesleyan Church  for a church building and a school for 200 children. [110] [note 27] Harrow to Verney Junction, Brill Branch and Wembley Park Station edit In 1868, the  Duke of Buckingham  opened the  Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway  (A&BR), a 12.75-mile (20.5\u00a0km) single track from  Aylesbury  to a new station at  Verney Junction  on the  Buckinghamshire Railway 's Bletchley to Oxford line. [113]  At the beginning lukewarm support had been given by the LNWR, which worked the Bletchley to Oxford line, but by the time the line had been built the relationship between the two companies had collapsed. [note 28]  The  Wycombe Railway  built a single-track railway from  Princes Risborough  to Aylesbury and when the GWR took over this company it ran shuttles from Princes Risborough through Aylesbury to Quainton Road and from Quainton Road to Verney Junction. [115] The A&BR had authority for a southern extension to Rickmansworth, connecting with the LNWR's  Watford and Rickmansworth Railway . Following discussions between the Duke and Watkin it was agreed that this line would be extended south to meet the Met at Harrow and permission for this extension was granted in 1874 [104] [note 29]  and Watkin joined the board of the A&BR in 1875. [116]  Money was not found for this scheme and the Met had to return to Parliament in 1880 and 1881 to obtain permission for a railway from Harrow to Aylesbury. [117] [note 30] Pinner  was reached in 1885 and an hourly service from  Rickmansworth  and  Northwood  to Baker Street started on 1 September 1887. [118]  By then raising money was becoming very difficult although there was local support for a station at  Chesham [109]  Authorised in 1885, double track from Rickmansworth was laid for 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km), then single to Chesham. [119]  Services to Chesham calling at  Chorley Wood  and Chalfont Road (now  Chalfont & Latimer ) started on 8 July 1889. [120] The Met took over the A&BR on 1 July 1891 [120]  and a temporary platform at Aylesbury opened on 1 September 1892 with trains calling at  Amersham Great Missenden Wendover  and  Stoke Mandeville . In 1894, the Met and GWR  joint station  at Aylesbury opened. [121]  Beyond Aylesbury to Verney Junction, the bridges were not strong enough for the Met's locomotives. The GWR refused to help, so locomotives were borrowed from the LNWR until two  D Class  locomotives were bought. The line was upgraded, doubled and the stations rebuilt to main-line standards, [122]  allowing a through Baker Street to  Verney Junction  service from 1 January 1897, calling at a new station at  Waddesdon Manor , a rebuilt  Quainton Road Granborough Road  and  Winslow Road [32] [123] From Quainton Road, the Duke of Buckingham had built a 6.5-mile (10.5\u00a0km) branch railway, the  Brill Tramway [124]  In 1899, there were four mixed passenger and goods trains each way between  Brill  and Quainton Road. There were suggestions of the Met buying the line and it took over operations in November 1899, [125]  renting the line for \u00a3600 a year. The track was relaid and stations rebuilt in 1903. Passenger services were provided by  A Class  and  D Class  locomotives and Oldbury rigid eight-wheeled carriages. [126] [127] In 1893, a new station at  Wembley Park  was opened, initially used by the  Old Westminsters Football Club , but primarily to serve a planned sports, leisure and exhibition centre. [128]  A 1,159-foot (353\u00a0m) tower (higher than the recently built  Eiffel Tower ) was planned, but the attraction was not a success and only the 200-foot (61\u00a0m) tall first stage was built. The tower became known as \" Watkin's Folly \" and was dismantled in 1907 after it was found to be tilting. [129] \nAround 1900, there were six stopping trains an hour between  Willesden Green  and Baker Street. One of these came from Rickmansworth and another from Harrow, the rest started at Willesden Green. There was also a train every two hours from Verney Junction, which stopped at all stations to Harrow, then Willesden Green and Baker Street. The timetable was arranged so that the fast train would leave Willesden Green just before a stopping service and arrived at Baker Street just behind the previous service. [130] Great Central Railway edit In 1906 the Great Central had two routes to London, by the Met via Amersham or the Great Central and Great Western Joint Railway via High Wycombe. Watkin was also director of the  Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway  (MS&LR) and had plans for a 99-mile (159\u00a0km) London extension to join the Met just north of Aylesbury. There were suggestions that Baker Street could be used as the London terminus, but by 1891\u20131892 the MS&LR had concluded it needed its own station and goods facilities in the  Marylebone  area. An Act for this railway was passed in 1893, but Watkin became ill and resigned his directorships in 1894. For a while after his departure the relationship between the companies turned sour. [87] In 1895, the MS&LR put forward a bill to Parliament to build two tracks from Wembley Park to Canfield Place, near Finchley Road station, to allow its express trains to pass the Met's stopping service. [131]  The Met protested before it was agreed that it would build the lines for the MS&LR's exclusive use. [132]  When rebuilding bridges over the lines from Wembley Park to Harrow for the MS&LR, seeing a future need the Met quadrupled the line at the same time and the MS&LR requested exclusive use of two tracks. [133]  The MS&LR had the necessary authority to connect to the Circle at Marylebone, but the Met suggested onerous terms. At the time the MS&LR was running short of money and abandoned the link. [134] Because of the state of the relationship between the two companies the MS&LR was unhappy being wholly reliant on the Met for access to London and, unlike its railway to the north, south of Aylesbury there were several speed restrictions and long climbs, up to 1 in 90 in places. In 1898, the MS&LR and the GWR jointly presented a bill to Parliament for a railway (the  Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway ) with short connecting branches from  Grendon Underwood , north of Quainton Road, to  Ashendon  and from Northolt to  Neasden . The Met protested, claiming that the bill was 'incompatible with the spirit and terms' of the agreements between it and the MS&LR. The MS&LR was given authority to proceed, but the Met was given the right to compensation. [135]  A temporary agreement was made to allow four MS&LR coal trains a day over the Met lines from 26 July 1898. The MS&LR wished these trains to also use the GWR route from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough into London, whereas the Met considered this was not covered by the agreement. A train scheduled to use the GWR route was not allowed access to the Met lines at Quainton Road in the early hours of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A subsequent court hearing found in the Met's favour, as it was a temporary arrangement. [136] The MS&LR changed its name to the  Great Central Railway  (GCR) in 1897 and the  Great Central Main Line  from London Marylebone to Manchester Central opened for passenger traffic on 15 March 1899. [124]  Negotiations about the line between the GCR and the Met took several years and in 1906 it was agreed that two tracks from Canfield Place to Harrow would be leased to the GCR for \u00a320,000 a year and the  Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway  was created, leasing the line from Harrow to Verney Junction and the Brill branch for \u00a344,000 a year, the GCR guaranteeing to place at least \u00a345,000 of traffic on the line. [137]  Aylesbury station, which had been jointly run by the GWR and the Met, was placed with a joint committee of the Great Western & Great Central and Metropolitan & Great Central Joint Committees, and generally known as Aylesbury Joint Station. The Met & GC Joint Committee took over the operation of the stations and line, but had no rolling stock. The Met provided the management and the GCR the accounts for the first five years before the companies switched functions, then alternating every five years until 1926. The Met maintained the line south of milepost 28.5 (south of Great Missenden), the GCR to the north. [138] Electrification, 1900\u201314 edit Development edit The jointly owned experimental passenger train that ran for six months in 1900 At the start of the 20th century, the District and the Met saw increased competition in central London from the new electric deep-level tube lines. With the opening in 1900 of the  Central London Railway  from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat fare of 2d, the District and the Met together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. [139]  The polluted atmosphere in the tunnels was becoming increasingly unpopular with passengers and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. [140]  Electrification had been considered by the Met as early as the 1880s, but such a method of traction was still in its infancy, and agreement would be needed with the District because of the shared ownership of the Inner Circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. This was considered a success, tenders were requested and in 1901 a Met and District joint committee recommended the  Ganz  three-phase  AC  system with overhead wires. [141]  This was accepted by both parties until the  Underground Electric Railways Company of London  (UERL) took control of the District. The UERL was led by the American  Charles Yerkes , whose experience in the United States led him to favour  DC  with a  third rail  similar to that on the  City & South London Railway  and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the  Board of Trade  a DC system with  four rails  was taken up and the railways began electrifying using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages. [142] \nIn 1904, the Met opened a 10.5\u00a0MW  coal-fired power station  at  Neasden , which supplied 11\u00a0kV 33.3\u00a0Hz current to five substations that converted this to 600\u00a0V\u00a0DC using  rotary converters [143] Meanwhile, the District had been building a line from Ealing to South Harrow and had authority for an extension to Uxbridge. [144]  In 1899, the District had problems raising the finance and the Met offered a rescue package whereby it would build a branch from Harrow to Rayners Lane and take over the line to Uxbridge, with the District retaining running rights for up to three trains an hour. [145]  The necessary Act was passed in 1899 and construction on the 7.5 miles (12.1\u00a0km) long branch started in September 1902, requiring 28 bridges and a 1.5-mile (2.4\u00a0km) long viaduct with 71 arches at Harrow. As this line was under construction it was included in the list of lines to be electrified, together with the railway from Baker Street to Harrow, [146]  the inner circle and the joint GWR and Met H&C. The Met opened the line to  Uxbridge  on 30 June 1904 with one intermediate station at  Ruislip , initially worked by steam. [144]  Wooden platforms the length of three cars opened at  Ickenham  on 25 September 1905, followed by similar simple structures at  Eastcote  and  Rayners Lane  on 26 May 1906. [147] Running electric trains edit Electric multiple units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. [148]  The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade for using a motor car to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services from the end of March while some trailers were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June. [147] On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both introduced electric units on the inner circle until later that day a Met multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District and the Met service was withdrawn. An incompatibility was found between the way the shoe-gear was mounted on Met trains and the District track and Met trains were withdrawn from the District and modified. Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes. [149] [150] The GWR built a 6 MW power station at Park Royal and electrified the line between Paddington and Hammersmith and the branch from Latimer Road to Kensington (Addison Road). An electric service with jointly owned rolling stock started on the H&CR on 5 November 1906. [151]  In the same year, the Met suspended running on the  East London Railway , terminating instead at the District station at  Whitechapel [32]  until that line was electrified in 1913. [152]  The H&CR service stopped running to Richmond over the L&SWR on 31 December 1906;  GWR steam rail motors  ran from Ladbroke Grove to Richmond until 31 December 1910. [153] The line beyond Harrow was not electrified so trains were hauled by an  electric locomotive  from Baker Street, changed for a  steam locomotive  en route. [142]  From 1 January 1907, the exchange took place at  Wembley Park [154]  From 19 July 1908, locomotives were changed at Harrow. [152]  GWR rush hour services to the city continued to operate, electric traction taking over from steam at Paddington [155]  from January 1907, [149]  although freight services to Smithfield continued to be steam hauled throughout. [156] [note 31] In 1908, Robert Selbie [note 32]  was appointed General Manager, a position he held until 1930. [160] \nIn 1909, limited through services to the City restarted. Baker Street station was rebuilt with four tracks and two island platforms in 1912. [161]  To cope with the rise in traffic the line south of Harrow was quadrupled, in 1913 from Finchley Road to Kilburn, in 1915 to Wembley Park; [162]  the line from Finchley Road to Baker Street remained double track, causing a bottleneck. [163] London Underground edit The joint U NDERGROUN D map published in 1908. The Metropolitan Railway is shown in red. To promote travel by the underground railways in London a joint marketing arrangement was agreed. In 1908, the Met joined this scheme, which included maps, joint publicity and through ticketing. U NDERGROUN D signs were used outside stations in Central London. Eventually the UERL controlled all the underground railways except the Met and the Waterloo & City and introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar. The Met responded with station boards with a red diamond and a blue bar. [164] \nFurther coordination in the form of a General Managers' Conference faltered after Selbie withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without any reference to the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met's competitive routes. [165]  Suggestions of merger with the Underground Group were rejected by Selbie, a press release of November 1912 noting the Met's interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main-line railways and its freight business. [166] East London Railway edit Main article:  East London Line After the Met and the District had withdrawn from the ELR in 1906, services were provided by the  South Eastern Railway , the  London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway  (LB&SCR) and the  Great Eastern Railway . Both the Met and the District wanted to see the line electrified, but could not justify the whole cost themselves. Discussions continued, and in 1911 it was agreed that the ELR would be electrified with the UERL providing power and the Met the train service. Parliamentary powers were obtained in 1912 and through services restarted on 31 March 1913, the Met running two trains an hour from both the SER's and the LB&SCR's  New Cross stations  to South Kensington and eight shuttles an hour alternately from the New Cross stations to  Shoreditch [167] [32] Great Northern & City Railway edit Main article:  Northern City Line The Great Northern & City Railway (GN&CR) was planned to allow trains to run from the GNR line at  Finsbury Park  directly into the City at Moorgate. The tunnels were large enough to take a main-line train with an internal diameter of 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m), in contrast to those of the Central London Railway with a diameter less than 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m). The GNR eventually opposed the scheme, and the line opened in 1904 with the northern terminus in tunnels underneath GNR Finsbury Park station. [168] Concerned that the GNR would divert its Moorgate services over the City Widened Lines to run via the GN&CR, the Met sought to take over the GN&CR. A bill was presented in 1912\u20131913 to allow this with extensions to join the GN&CR to the inner circle between Moorgate and Liverpool Street and to the  Waterloo & City line . The takeover was authorised, but the new railway works were removed from the bill after opposition from City property owners. The following year, a bill was jointly presented by the Met and GNR with amended plans that would have also allowed a connection between the GN&CR and GNR at Finsbury Park. Opposed, this time by the  North London Railway , this bill was withdrawn. [169] War and \"Metro-land\", 1914\u201332 edit World War I edit On 28 July 1914 World War I broke out and on 5 August 1914 the Met was made subject to government control in the form of the  Railway Executive Committee . It lost significant numbers of staff who volunteered for military service and from 1915 women were employed as booking clerks and ticket collectors. [170]  The City Widened Lines assumed major strategic importance as a link between the channel ports and the main lines to the north, used by troop movements and freight. During the four years of war the line saw 26,047 military trains which carried 250,000 long tons (254,000\u00a0t) of materials; [171]  the sharp curves prevented ambulance trains returning with wounded using this route. [172]  Government control was relinquished on 15 August 1921. [170] Metro-land development edit The cover of the Metro-Land guide published in 1921 Unlike other railway companies, which were required to dispose of surplus land, the Met was in a privileged position with clauses in its acts allowing it to retain such land that it believed was necessary for future railway use. [note 33]  Initially, the surplus land was managed by the Land Committee, made up of Met directors. [174]  In the 1880s, at the same time as the railway was extending beyond Swiss Cottage and building the workers' estate at Neasden, [110]  roads and sewers were built at Willesden Park Estate and the land was sold to builders. Similar developments followed at Cecil Park, near  Pinner  and, after the failure of the tower at Wembley, plots were sold at Wembley Park. [175] [note 34] In 1912, Selbie, then General Manager, thought that some professionalism was needed and suggested a company be formed to take over from the Surplus Lands Committee to develop estates near the railway. [178]  World War I delayed these plans and it was 1919, with expectation of a housing boom, [179]  before  Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited  (MRCE) was formed. Concerned that Parliament might reconsider the unique position the Met held, the railway company sought legal advice, which was that the Met had authority to hold land, but had none to develop it. A new company was created; all but one of its directors were also directors of the Met. [180]  MRCE developed estates at  Kingsbury Garden Village  near  Neasden Wembley Park , Cecil Park and Grange Estate at  Pinner , and the Cedars Estate at  Rickmansworth , and created places such as  Harrow Garden Village [179] [180] The term  Metro-land  was coined by the Met's marketing department in 1915 when the  Guide to the Extension Line  became the  Metro-land  guide, priced at 1 d . This promoted the land served by the Met for the walker, visitor and later the house-hunter. [178]  Published annually until 1932, the last full year of independence, the guide extolled the benefits of  \"The good air of the Chilterns\" , using language such as  \"Each lover of Metroland may well have his own favourite wood beech and coppice\u00a0\u2014 all tremulous green loveliness in Spring and russet and gold in October\" [181]  The dream promoted was of a modern home in beautiful countryside with a fast railway service to central London. [182] From about 1914 the company promoted itself as \"The Met\", but after 1920 the commercial manager, John Wardle, ensured that timetables and other publicity material used \"Metro\" instead. [1] [note 35]  Land development also occurred in central London when in 1929 Chiltern court, a large, luxurious block of apartments, opened at Baker Street, [182] [note 36]  designed by the Met's architect  Charles Walter Clark , who was also responsible for the design of a number of station reconstructions in outer \"Metro-land\" at this time. [163] Infrastructure improvements edit To improve outer passenger services, powerful 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h)  H Class  steam locomotives [186]  were introduced in 1920, followed in 1922\u20131923 by new electric locomotives with a top speed of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). [187]  The generating capacity of the power station at Neasden was increased to approximately 35\u00a0MW [188]  and on 5 January 1925 electric services reached  Rickmansworth , allowing the locomotive change over point to be moved. [163] In 1924 and 1925, the  British Empire Exhibition  was held on the Wembley Park Estate and the adjacent  Wembley Park station  was rebuilt with a new island platform with a covered bridge linking to the exhibition. [189]  The Met exhibited an electric multiple unit car in 1924, which returned the following year with electric locomotive No. 15, subsequently to be named \"Wembley 1924\". [190]  A national sports arena,  Wembley Stadium  was built on the site of Watkin's Tower. [189]  With a capacity of 125,000 spectators it was first used for the  FA Cup Final  on 28 April 1923 where the match was preceded by chaotic scenes as crowds in excess of capacity surged into the stadium. In the 1926  Metro-land  edition, the Met boasted that that had carried 152,000 passengers to Wembley Park on that day. [182] In 1925, a branch opened from Rickmansworth to  Watford . There had been a railway station in Watford since 1837, [191] [note 37]  but in 1895 the Watford Tradesmen's Association had approached the Met with a proposal for a line to Watford via Stanmore. They approached again in 1904, this time jointly with the local District Council, to discuss a new plan for a shorter branch from Rickmansworth. [192]  A possible route was surveyed in 1906 and a bill deposited in 1912 seeking authority for a joint Met & GCR line from Rickmansworth to Watford town centre that would cross  Cassiobury Park  on an embankment. There was local opposition to the embankment and the line was cut back to a station with goods facilities just short of the park. The amended Act was passed on 7 August 1912 and the Watford Joint Committee formed before the start of World War I in 1914 delayed construction. After the war, the  Trade Facilities Act 1921  offered government financial guarantees for capital projects that promoted employment, and taking advantage of this construction started in 1922. During construction the  Railways Act 1921  meant that in 1923 the  London and North Eastern Railway  (LNER) replaced the GCR. Where the branch met the extension line two junctions were built, allowing trains access to Rickmansworth and London. Services started on 3 November 1925 with one intermediate station at Croxley Green (now  Croxley ), with services provided by Met electric multiple units to Liverpool Street via  Moor Park  and Baker Street and by LNER steam trains to Marylebone. [193]  The Met also ran a shuttle service between Watford and Rickmansworth. [194]  During 1924\u20131925 the flat junction north of Harrow was replaced with a 1,200 feet (370\u00a0m) long diveunder to separate Uxbridge and main-line trains. [195]  Another attempt was made in 1927 to extend the Watford branch across Cassiobury Park to the town centre, the Met purchasing  a property on Watford High Street  with the intention of converting it to a station. The proposals for tunnelling under the park proved controversial and the scheme was dropped. [196] A 1925 plan for a relief line from Kilburn & Brondesbury to Edgware Road to relieve the tunnels between Finchley Road and Baker Street There remained a bottleneck at Finchley Road where the fast and slow tracks converged into one pair for the original M&SJWR tunnels to Baker Street. In 1925, a plan was developed for two new tube tunnels, large enough for the Met rolling stock that would join the extension line at a junction north of  Kilburn & Brondesbury station  and run beneath Kilburn High Street, Maida Vale and Edgware Road to Baker Street. [197] [198]  The plan included three new stations, at Quex Road, Kilburn Park Road and Clifton Road, [199]  but did not progress after  Ministry of Transport  revised its  Requirements for Passenger Lines  requiring a means of exit in an emergency at the ends of trains running in deep-level tubes \u2013 compartment stock used north of Harrow did not comply with this requirement. [200]  Edgware Road station had been rebuilt with four platforms and had train destination indicators including stations such as Verney Junction and Uxbridge. [201] In the 1920s, off-peak there was a train every 4\u20135\u00a0minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden; most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5\u20133\u00a0minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. [202]  On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6\u00a0minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. [203]  Maintaining a frequency of ten trains an hour on the circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour. [204] [note 38] Construction started in 1929 on a branch from Wembley Park to  Stanmore  to serve a new housing development at  Canons Park [188]  with stations at  Kingsbury  and Canons Park (Edgware) (renamed  Canons Park  in 1933). [32]  The government again guaranteed finance, this time under the Development Loans Guarantees & Grants Act, the project also quadrupling the tracks from Wembley Park to Harrow. The line was electrified with automatic colour light signals controlled from a signal box at Wembley Park and opened on 9 December 1932. [188] [205] London Passenger Transport Board, 1933 edit Unlike the UERL, the Met profited directly from development of Metro-land housing estates near its lines; [179]  the Met had always paid a  dividend  to its shareholders. [206]  The early accounts are untrustworthy, but by the late 19th century it was paying a dividend of about 5 per cent. This dropped from 1900 onwards as electric trams and the Central London Railway attracted passengers away; [207]  a low of \u200b 1 2  per cent was reached in 1907\u20131908. Dividends rose to 2 per cent in 1911\u20131913 as passengers returned after electrification; the outbreak of war in 1914 reduced the dividend to 1 per cent. [206]  By 1921 recovery was sufficient for a dividend of \u200b 2 1 4  per cent to be paid and then, during the post-war housing boom, for the rate to steadily rise to 5 per cent in 1924\u20131925. The  1926 General Strike  reduced this to 3 per cent; by 1929 it was back to 4 per cent. [206] [179] In 1913, the Met had refused a merger proposal made by the UERL and it remained stubbornly independent under the leadership of Robert Selbie. [179]  The Railways Act 1921, which became law on 19 August 1921, did not list any of London's underground railways among the companies that were to be grouped, although at the draft stage the Met had been included. [208]  When proposals for integration of public transport in London were published in 1930, the Met argued that it should have the same status as the four main-line railways, and it was incompatible with the UERL because of its freight operations; the government saw the Met in a similar way to the District as they jointly operated the inner circle. After the  London Passenger Transport Bill , aimed primarily at co-ordinating the small independent bus services, [209]  was published on 13 March 1931, the Met spent \u00a311,000 opposing it. [210]  The bill survived a change in government in 1931 and the Met gave no response to a proposal made by the new administration that it could remain independent if it were to lose its running powers over the circle. The directors turned to negotiating compensation for its shareholders; [211]  by then passenger numbers had fallen due to competition from buses and the depression. [212]  In 1932, the last full year of operation, a \u200b 1 5 8  per cent dividend was declared. [206]  On 1 July 1933, the  London Passenger Transport Board  (LPTB), was created as a public corporation and the Met was amalgamated with the other underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators. Met shareholders received \u00a319.7 million in LPTB stock. [213] [note 39] Legacy edit The  coat of arms  of the Metropolitan Railway, combining the arms of London, Middlesex, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire For a history of the line from 1933 to 1988, see  Metropolitan line (1933\u201388) The Met became the Metropolitan line of  London Transport , the Brill branch closing in 1935, followed by the line from Quainton Road to Verney Junction in 1936. The LNER took over steam workings and freight. In 1936, Metropolitan line services were extended from  Whitechapel  to  Barking  along the District line. The  New Works Programme  meant that in 1939 the  Bakerloo line  was extended from Baker Street in new twin tunnels and stations to Finchley Road before taking over the intermediate stations to Wembley Park and the Stanmore branch. [214]  The branch transferred to the Jubilee line when that line opened in 1979. [32]  The  Great Northern and City Railway  remained isolated and was managed as a section of the  Northern line  until being taken over by  British Railways  in 1976.\n Steam locomotives were used north of Rickmansworth until the early 1960s when they were replaced following the electrification to Amersham and the introduction of electric multiple units, London Transport withdrawing its service north of Amersham. [215]  In 1988, the route from Hammersmith to Aldgate and Barking was branded as the  Hammersmith & City line , and the route from the New Cross stations to Shoreditch became the  East London line , leaving the  Metropolitan line  as the route from Aldgate to Baker Street and northwards to stations via Harrow.\n After amalgamation in 1933 the \"Metro-land\" brand was rapidly dropped. [182]  In the mid-20th century, the spirit of Metro-land was remembered in  John Betjeman 's poems such as \"The Metropolitan Railway\" published in the  A Few Late Chrysanthemums  collection in 1954 [216]  and he later reached a wider audience with his television documentary  Metro-land , first broadcast on 26 February 1973. [217]  The suburbia of Metro-land is one locale of  Julian Barnes Bildungsroman  novel  Metroland , first published in 1980. [218]  A film based on the novel, also called  Metroland , was released in 1997. [219] Accident edit On 18 June 1925, electric locomotive No. 4 collided with a passenger train at  Baker Street station  when a signal was changed from green to red just as the locomotive was passing it. Six people were injured. [220] Goods edit Until 1880 the Met ran no goods trains, but  goods trains  ran over its tracks from 20 February 1866 when the GNR began a service to the LC&DR via Farringdon Street, followed by a service from the  Midland Railway  from July 1868. The GNR, the GWR and the Midland all opened goods depots in the Farringdon area, accessed from the City Widened Lines. Goods traffic was to play an important part of Met traffic on the extension line out of Baker Street. In 1880, the Met secured the coal traffic of the Harrow District Gas Co., worked from an exchange siding with the Midland at Finchley Road to a coal yard at Harrow. Goods and coal depots were provided at most of the stations on the extension line as they were built. [221]  Goods for London were initially handled at Willesden, with delivery by road [222]  or by transfer to the Midland. [223]  The arrival of the GCR gave connections to the north at Quainton Road and south via Neasden, Acton and Kew. [224] The entrance to Vine Street depot in the 1910s In 1909, the Met opened Vine Street goods depot near Farringdon with two sidings each seven wagons long and a regular service from West Hampstead. [note 40]  Trains were electrically hauled with a maximum length of 14 wagons and restricted to 250 long tons (254\u00a0t) inwards and 225 long tons (229\u00a0t) on the return. In 1910, the depot handled 11,400 long tons (11,600\u00a0t), which rose to 25,100 long tons (25,500\u00a0t) in 1915. [226]  In 1913, the depot was reported above capacity, but after World War I motor road transport became an important competitor and by the late 1920s traffic had reduced to manageable levels. [227] Coal for the steam locomotives, the power station at  Neasden  and local gasworks were brought in via Quainton Road. [228] [229]  Milk was conveyed from Vale of Aylesbury to the London suburbs and foodstuffs from Vine Street to Uxbridge for Alfred Button & Son, wholesale grocers. Fish to  Billingsgate Market  via the Met and the District joint station at Monument caused some complaints, leaving the station approaches in an \"indescribably filthy condition\". The District suggested a separate entrance for the fish, but nothing was done. The traffic reduced significantly when the GCR introduced road transport to Marylebone, but the problem remained until 1936, being one reason the LPTB gave for abolishing the carrying of parcels on Inner Circle trains. [229] Initially private contractors were used for road delivery, but from 1919 the Met employed its own hauliers. [222]  In 1932, before it became part of  London Underground , the company owned 544 goods vehicles and carried 162,764 long tons (165,376\u00a0t) of coal, 2,478,212 long tons (2,517,980\u00a0t) of materials and 1,015,501 long tons (1,031,797\u00a0t) tons of goods. [230] Rolling stock edit Steam locomotives edit See also:  Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives One of six K Class 2-6-4 steam locomotives introduced to the Metropolitan Railway in 1925 to haul freight trains Concern about smoke and steam in the tunnels led to new designs of  steam locomotive . Before the line opened, in 1861 trials were made with the experimental \"hot brick\" locomotive nicknamed  Fowler's Ghost . This was unsuccessful and the first public trains were hauled by broad-gauge  GWR Metropolitan Class condensing  2-4-0  tank locomotives  designed by  Daniel Gooch . They were followed by standard-gauge GNR locomotives [231]  until the Met received its own  4-4-0  tank locomotives, built by  Beyer Peacock  of Manchester. Their design is frequently attributed to the Met's Engineer  John Fowler , but the locomotive was a development of one Beyer had built for the Spanish  Tudela to Bilbao Railway , Fowler specifying only the driving wheel diameter, axle weight and the ability to navigate sharp curves. [37]  Eighteen were ordered in 1864, initially carrying names, [232]  and by 1870 40 had been built. To reduce smoke underground, at first  coke  was burnt, changed in 1869 to  smokeless  Welsh coal. [42] From 1879, more locomotives were needed, and the design was updated and 24 were delivered between 1879 and 1885. [233]  Originally they were painted bright olive green lined in black and yellow, chimneys copper capped with the locomotive number in brass figures at the front and domes of polished brass. In 1885, the colour changed to a dark red known as Midcared, and this was to remain the standard colour, taken up as the colour for the Metropolitan line by London Transport in 1933. [234]  When in 1925 the Met classified its locomotives by letters of the alphabet, these were assigned  A Class  and B Class. [210]  When the M&SJWR was being built, it was considered that they would struggle on the gradients and five Worcester Engine  0-6-0  tank locomotives were delivered in 1868. It was soon found that A and B Classes could manage trains without difficulty and the 0-6-0Ts were sold to the  Taff Vale Railway  in 1873 and 1875. [235] From 1891, more locomotives were needed for work on the extension line from Baker Street into the country. Four  C Class 0-4-4 ) locomotives, a development of South Eastern Railway's  'Q' Class , were received in 1891. [236] [235]  In 1894, two  D Class  locomotives were bought to run between Aylesbury and Verney Junction. These were not fitted with the condensing equipment needed to work south of Finchley Road. [237]  Four more were delivered in 1895 with condensing equipment; these were prohibited working south of Finchley Road. [238]  In 1896, two  E Class 0-4-4 ) locomotives were built at Neasden works, followed by one in 1898 to replace the original Class A No. 1, damaged in an accident. Four more were built by Hawthorn Leslie & Co in 1900 and 1901. [239]  To cope with the growing freight traffic on the extension line, the Met received four  F Class 0-6-2 ) locomotives in 1901, similar to the E Class except for the wheel arrangement and without steam heat. [240]  In 1897 and 1899, the Met received two  0-6-0 saddle tank  locomotives to a standard  Peckett  design. Unclassified by the Met, these were generally used for  shunting  at Neasden and Harrow. [241] Many locomotives were made redundant by the electrification of the inner London lines in 1905\u20131906. By 1907, 40 of the class A and B locomotives had been sold or scrapped and by 1914 only 13 locomotives of these classes had been retained [242]  for shunting, departmental work and working trains over the  Brill Tramway [243]  The need for more powerful locomotives for both passenger and freight services meant that, in 1915, four  G Class 0-6-4 ) locomotives arrived from Yorkshire Engine Co. [244]  Eight 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) capable  H Class 4-4-4 ) locomotives were built in 1920 and 1921 and used mainly on express passenger services. [245]  To run longer, faster and less frequent freight services in 1925 six  K Class 2-6-4 ) locomotives arrived, rebuilt from 2-6-0 locomotives manufactured at  Woolwich Arsenal  after World War I. These were not permitted south of Finchley Road. [246] Two locomotives survive: A Class No. 23 (LT L45) at the  London Transport Museum [247]  and E Class No. 1 (LT L44) at the  Buckinghamshire Railway Centre [248]  No.1 ran in steam as part of the Met's 150th anniversary celebrations during 2013. [249] Carriages edit The Met opened with no stock of its own, with the GWR and then the GNR providing services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment  carriages  constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the  Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co. , based on the GWR design but standard gauge. [231] [note 41]  Lighting was provided by gas\u00a0\u2014 two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, [252]  and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. [253]  Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at the front and back of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. [254] [255]  This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all carriages. The operation of the  chain brake  could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. [256] [253]  In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation. [257] Metropolitan Railway Jubilee carriage No. 353 at Ongar station in July 2013 In 1870, some close-coupled rigid-wheelbase four-wheeled carriages were built by Oldbury. [258]  After some derailments in 1887, a new design of 27\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (8.38\u00a0m) long rigid-wheelbase four-wheelers known as Jubilee Stock was built by the  Cravens Railway Carriage and Wagon Co.  for the extension line. With the pressurised gas lighting system and non-automatic vacuum brakes from new, steam heating was added later. More trains followed in 1892, but all had been withdrawn by 1912. [259]  By May 1893, following an order by the Board of Trade, automatic vacuum brakes had been fitted to all carriages and locomotives. [260]  A Jubilee Stock first class carriage was restored to carry passengers during the Met's 150th anniversary celebrations. [249] [261] Bogie stock was built by Ashbury in 1898 and by Cravens and at Neasden Works in 1900. This gave a better ride quality, steam heating, automatic vacuum brakes, electric lighting and upholstered seating in all classes. [236] [262] [263]  The  Bluebell Railway  has four 1898\u20131900 Ashbury and Cravens carriages and a fifth, built at Neasden, is at the London Transport Museum. [264] Competition with the  GCR  on outer suburban services on the extension line saw the introduction of more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. [152]  Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. [265]  Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. [263]  Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, [266]  conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent  gapping [265]  Two rakes were formed with a  Pullman  coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. [267] [note 42]  The  Vintage Carriages Trust  has three preserved Dreadnought carriages. [270] From 1906, some of the Ashbury bogie stock was converted into electric multiple units. [271]  Some Dreadnought carriages were used with electric motor cars, and two-thirds remained in use as locomotive hauled stock on the extension line. [272] Electric locomotives edit An electric locomotive and train on the Metropolitan Railway in the 1920s See also:  Metropolitan Railway electric locomotives After electrification, the outer suburban routes were worked with carriage stock hauled from Baker Street by an electric locomotive that was exchanged for a steam locomotive en route. The Met ordered 20 electric locomotives from Metropolitan Amalgamated with two types of electrical equipment. The first ten, with  Westinghouse  equipment, entered service in 1906. These 'camel-back' bogie locomotives had a central cab, [152]  weighed 50\u00a0tons, [273]  and had four 215\u00a0hp (160\u00a0kW) traction motors [274]  The second type were built to a box car design with  British Thomson-Houston  equipment, [152]  replaced with the Westinghouse type in 1919. [274] In the early 1920s, the Met placed an order with  Metropolitan-Vickers  of  Barrow-in-Furness  for rebuilding the 20 electric locomotives. When work started on the first locomotive, it was found to be impractical and uneconomical and the order was changed to building new locomotives using some equipment recovered from the originals. The new locomotives were built in 1922\u20131923 and named after famous London residents. They had four 300\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) motors, totalling 1,200\u00a0hp (890\u00a0kW) (one-hour rating), giving a top speed of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). [187] No. 5 \" John Hampden \" is preserved as a static display at the London Transport Museum [275]  and No. 12 \" Sarah Siddons \" has been used for heritage events, and ran during the Met's 150th anniversary celebrations. [276] Electric multiple units edit Main article:  Metropolitan Railway electric multiple units The first order for  electric multiple units  was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 trailers and 20 motor cars with Westinghouse equipment, which ran as 6-car trains. First and third class accommodation was provided in open saloons, second class being withdrawn from the Met. [277]  Access was at the ends via open lattice gates [278]  and the units were modified so that they could run off-peak as 3-car units. [279]  For the joint  Hammersmith & City line  service, the Met and the GWR purchased 20 \u00d7 6-cars trains with Thomson-Houston equipment. [280]  In 1904, a further order was placed by the Met for 36 motor cars and 62 trailers with an option for another 20 motor cars and 40 trailers. Problems with the Westinghouse equipment led to Thomson-Houston equipment being specified when the option was taken up and more powerful motors being fitted. [278]  Before 1918, the motor cars with the more powerful motors were used on the circle with three trailers. [281]  The open lattice gates were seen as a problem when working above ground and all of the cars had gates replaced with vestibules by 1907. [279]  Having access only through the two end doors became a problem on the busy circle and centre sliding doors were fitted from 1911. [282] From 1906, some of the Ashbury bogie stock was converted into multiple units by fitting cabs, control equipment and motors. [271]  In 1910, two motor cars were modified with driving cabs at both ends. They started work on the Uxbridge-South Harrow shuttle service, being transferred to the Addison Road shuttle in 1918. From 1925 to 1934 these vehicles were used between Watford and Rickmansworth. [283] In 1913, an order was placed for 23 motor cars and 20 trailers, saloon cars with sliding doors at the end and the middle. These started work on the circle, including the new service to New Cross via the ELR.  [284]  In 1921, 20 motor cars, 33 trailers and six first-class driving trailers were received with three pairs of double sliding doors on each side. These were introduced on the circle. [285] A T stock multiple unit at Neasden Between 1927 and 1933 multiple unit compartment stock was built by the  Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon  and  Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Co.  for services from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth. The first order was only for motor cars; half had Westinghouse brakes, Metro-Vickers control systems and four MV153 motors; they replaced the motor cars working with bogie stock trailers. The rest of the motor cars had the same motor equipment but used vacuum brakes, and worked with converted 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to form 'MV' units. In 1929, 'MW' stock was ordered, 30 motor coaches and 25 trailers similar to the 'MV' units, but with Westinghouse brakes. A further batch of 'MW' stock was ordered in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-coach trains, and included additional trailers to increase the length of the previous 'MW' batch trains to eight coaches. These had  GEC  WT545 motors, and although designed to work in multiple with the MV153, this did not work well in practice. After the Met became part of London Underground, the MV stock was fitted with Westinghouse brakes and the cars with GEC motors were re-geared to allow them to work in multiple with the MV153-motored cars. In 1938, nine 8-coach and ten 6-coach MW units were re-designated  T Stock [286]  A trailer coach built in 1904/05 is stored at London Transport Museum's Acton Depot; it has been badly damaged by fire, [287]  and the  Spa Valley Railway  is home to two T stock coaches. [288] Notes edit The company promoted itself as \"The Met\" from about 1914. [1]  The Railway is referred to as \"the Met\" or \"the Metropolitan\" in historical accounts such as  Jackson 1986 Simpson 2003 Horne 2003 Green 1987 , and  Bruce 1983 In 1801, approximately one million people lived in the area that is now  Greater London . By 1851 this had doubled. [3] The area of the ban was bounded by  London Bridge Borough High Street , Blackman Street, Borough Street,  Lambeth Road , Vauxhall Road,  Vauxhall Bridge Vauxhall Bridge Road Grosvenor Place Park Lane Edgware Road , New Road,  City Road Finsbury Square , and  Bishopsgate [7] The route was to run from the south end of Westbourne Terrace, under Grand Junction Road (now Sussex Gardens), Southampton Road (now Old Marylebone Road) and New Road (now  Marylebone Road  and  Euston Road ). A branch was planned to connect to the GWR terminus. [10] Roughly equivalent to \u00a393,000,000 in 2016. Time limits were included in such legislation to encourage the railway company to complete the construction of its line as quickly as possible. They also prevented unused permissions acting as an indefinite block to other proposals. Roughly equivalent to \u00a316,000,000 in 2016. Instead of connecting to the GWR's terminus, the Met built its own station at Bishop's Road parallel to Paddington station and to the north. The Met connected to the GWR's tracks beyond Bishop's Road station. [16] The shares were later sold by the corporation for a profit. [17] Contractors for the works were Smith & Knight to the west of Euston Square and John Jay on the eastern section. [16] According to the Metropolitan Railway, the cost of constructing the line on an elevated viaduct would have been four times the cost of constructing it in tunnel. [29] Built by  Beyer Peacock  of Manchester the design of the locomotives is frequently attributed to the Metropolitan Engineer  John Fowler , but the locomotive was a development of one Beyer Peacock had built for the Spanish  Tudela to Bilbao Railway , Fowler specifying only the driving wheel diameter, axle weight, and the ability to navigate sharp curves. [37] This report noted that between Edgware Road and King's Cross there were 528 passenger and 14 freight trains every weekday and during the peak hour there were 19 trains each way between Baker Street and King's Cross, 15\u00a0long\u00a0cwt (760\u00a0kg) of coal was burnt and 1,650\u00a0imp\u00a0gal (7,500\u00a0L) water was used, half of which was condensed, the rest evaporating. [44] In the  Metropolitan Railway Act 1861  and the  Metropolitan Railway (Finsbury Circus Extension) Act 1861  and  Metropolitan Railway Act  was given royal assent on 25 July 1864 approving the additional tracks to King's Cross. One of these tunnels, completed in 1862, was used to bring the GNR-loaned rolling stock on to the Metropolitan Railway when the GWR withdrew its trains in August 1863. [49] For a  Hammersmith, Paddington and City Junction Railway [56] The L&SWR tracks to Richmond now form part of the London Underground's District line. Stations between Hammersmith and Richmond served by the Met were  Ravenscourt Park Turnham Green Gunnersbury , and  Kew Gardens [32] In November 1863,  The Times  reported that about 30 railway schemes for London had been submitted for consideration in the next parliamentary session. Many of which seemed \"to have been prepared on the spur of the moment, without much consideration either as to the cost of construction or as to the practicability of working them when made.\" [65] These Acts were the  Metropolitan Railway (Notting Hill and Brompton Extension) Act  and the  Metropolitan Railway (Tower Hill Extension) Act , and the  Metropolitan District Railway Act  created the Metropolitan District Railway. [66] Sources differ about the running of the first 'inner circle' services.  Jackson 1986 , p.\u00a056 says the operation was shared equally, whereas  Lee 1956 , pp.\u00a028\u201329 states the Met ran all the services. The station was completed on 19 July 1871, the Metropolitan and the District running a joint connecting bus service from the station to the  1871 International Exhibition [81] Watkin was also  MP  for  Hythe, Kent  and encouraged the SER to back a  channel tunnel  between English and France. By 1883 a tunnel 2,026 yards (1.853\u00a0km) long, 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) in diameter had been dug from the English side, with a similar tunnel 1,825 yards (1.669\u00a0km) long from the French side, but in 1882 work was halted after the  High Court  ruled that permission had not been granted to proceed beyond the low water mark. Subsequent efforts to obtain such permission were unsuccessful due to military advice which emphasised the risk of invasion. [86]  It is commonly reported that Watkin had aspirations to build a through route from Manchester or Sheffield to the continent via this channel tunnel, but no evidence exists of this ambition. [87] [85] The  Metropolitan and District Railways (City Lines and Extensions) Act, 1879  received royal assent on 11 August 1879. [92] The East London Railway now forms part of the  London Overground . It passes under the  Thames  through the 1843  Thames tunnel . Stations between St Mary's and New Cross served by the Met were  Shadwell Wapping Rotherhithe  and Deptford Road (now  Surrey Quays [32] The  Metropolitan & Saint John's Wood Railway Act  was given royal assent on 21 July 1873. [104] The  Kingsbury and Harrow Bill  was jointly promoted by the Met and M&SJWR and received royal assent on 16 July 1874. [104] The streets were labelled 'A' and 'B' until they became Quainton Street and Verney Street in 1903. [111]  The estate was made a  conservation area  in 1989. [112] The LNWR leased the line, absorbing the Buckinghamshire Railway on 21 July 1879. [114] The  London & Aylesbury Railway Act  was given royal assent in 1871. The  Rickmansworth and Harrow Extension Act  received royal assent on 16 July 1874 [104] The  Rickmansworth Extension Railway Act  authorising the line to Rickmansworth was given royal assent on 6 August 1880. The  Aylesbury and Rickmansworth Railway Act  for the line to Aylesbury received royal assent on 18 July 1881. [117] Some trains continued to be steam hauled. In September 1909, an excursion train travelled from Verney Junction to Ramsgate and returned, a Met locomotive being exchanged for a SE&CR locomotive at Blackfriars. [157]  On 1 October 1961, the Southern Counties Touring Society arranged a train hauled by steam locomotive Met No. 1 (then L44) from Stanmore to New Cross Gate via Farringdon and the East London Line. [158] Robert Hope Selbie  CBE  (1868\u20131930) was educated at  Manchester Grammar School  and  Owen's College , Manchester, and joined the  Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway  in 1883, working as secretary to the general manager and assistant to the chief traffic manager. He was secretary of the Met from 1903, general manager from 1908, appointed a director of MRCE in 1919, and became a director of the Met in 1922. His CBE was obtained during World War I for his services to the  Board of Trade , the Road Transport Board and the Army Forage Committee. He died in 1930 attending his son's  confirmation  service at St Paul's Cathedral. [159] The Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 required railways to sell off surplus lands within ten years of the time given for completion of the work in the line's enabling Act. [173] As at Neasden, Cecil Park [176]  and Willesden [177]  have both been declared  conservation areas Wardle wished a new sign at Euston Square to read EUSTON SQUARE METRO, but he was overruled by Selbie and METROPOLITAN RAILWAY was spelt in full. [183] Chiltern Court became one of the most prestigious addresses in London. It was home to, among others, the novelists  Arnold Bennett  and  H.\u00a0G.\u00a0Wells [184]  A  blue plaque  commemorating Wells was added to the building on 8 May 2002. [185] The original station moved to its current location at  Watford Junction railway station  in 1858. [191] The District continued to provide four trains on Sundays to keep crews familiar with the route. [204] This was made up of \u00a37.2 million of 4.5% 'A' stock, \u00a32 million of 5% 'A' stock, \u00a35.3 million of 5% 'B' stock and \u00a35.1 million in 'C' stock. [213] Other railway's goods depots had already opened near Farringdon on the Widened Lines. Smithfield Market Sidings opened 1 May 1869, serviced by the GWR. The GNR opened its depot on 2 November 1874, the Midland following with its Whitecross depot on 1 January 1878. [225] A preserved carriage at the  Kent and East Sussex Railway  was thought to be a short four-wheeled District Railway first class unit, but is now thought to be a cut-down Met eight-wheeler. [250] [251] Named  Mayflower  and  Galatea  (after the entrants of the sixth  America's Cup  race in 1886 [268] ) each Pullman coach seated up to 19 passengers and for a supplementary fare of 6d or 1s breakfast, luncheon, tea or supper could be purchased. They contained a toilet and were built with steam heating; electric heating being fitted in 1925.

Thus, the logical division to discuss the history and present-day state of railways in these areas is by geographical division, rather than the nationalist division of nation states.\n The United Kingdom is a member of the  International Union of Railways  (UIC).  The  UIC Country Code  for United Kingdom is 70.\n Rail transport in Great Britain  discusses rail transport on Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales.

Refresh with new selections below  (purge) Selected article The  City and South London Railway  (C&SLR) was the first deep-level underground \"tube\"  railway  in the world, [1]  and the first major railway in the world to use  electric traction . Originally intended for cable-hauled trains, the collapse of the cable contractor while the railway was under construction forced a change to electric traction before the line opened \u2013 an experimental technology at the time. \n When opened in 1890, it served six stations and ran for a distance of 5.1 kilometres (3.2\u00a0mi) in a pair of tunnels between the  City of London  and  Stockwell , passing under the  River Thames . The diameter of the tunnels restricted the size of the trains and the small carriages with their high-backed seating were nicknamed  padded cells . The railway was extended several times north and south; eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of 21.7\u00a0km (13.5\u00a0mi) from  Camden Town  in north London to  Morden  in  Surrey More selected articles...

A  train station railway station railroad station , or  depot see below ) is a  railway  facility or area where  trains  regularly stop to load or unload  passengers  or  freight . It generally consists of at least one  track -side  platform  and a  station building  (depot) providing such ancillary services as  ticket  sales and  waiting rooms . If a station is on a  single-track  line, it often has a  passing loop  to facilitate traffic movements. The smallest stations are most often referred to as \" stops \" or, in some parts of the world, as \" halts flag stops Stations may be at ground level, underground, or elevated. Connections may be available to intersecting  rail lines  or other transport modes such as  buses , trams or other  rapid transit  systems.\n Contents 1 Terminology 2 History 3 Station facilities 4 Station configurations 4.1 Tracks 5 Terminus 6 Junction 7 Stop 7.1 Halt 8 Accessibility 9 Goods stations 10 Largest, busiest and highest stations 10.1 Worldwide 10.2 Europe 10.3 North America 10.4 Asia 11 Gallery 12 See also 13 Notes 14 References 15 External links Terminology edit Glory of Commerce , a sculptural group featuring  Hercules Minerva , and  Mercury , sits atop  Grand Central Terminal  in  Midtown Manhattan , New York City, one of the ten busiest  tourist attractions  in the world.

[2] [3] [4]  In British usage, the word  station  is commonly understood to mean a railway station unless otherwise qualified. [5]  In  American English , the most common term in contemporary usage is  train station railroad station  and  railway station  are less common, though they have been more common in the past. [6] In North America, the term  depot  is sometimes used as an alternative name for  station , along with the compound forms  train depot railway depot , and  railroad depot , but also applicable for goods, [7]  and the term  depot  is not used in reference to  vehicle maintenance facilities  in  American English History edit .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}} Broad Green station Liverpool, England , shown in 1962, opened in 1830, is the oldest station  site  in the world still in use as a passenger station. Baker Street station , London, opened in 1863, was  the world's first station to be completely underground. Its original part, seen here, is just below the surface and was constructed by  cut-and-cover  tunnelling. Liverpool Lime Street station's  frontage resembles a ch\u00e2teau and is the world's oldest used terminus Gare du Nord  is one of the six large terminus stations of the  SNCF  mainline network for Paris. It is the busiest railroad station outside Japan, serving 206,7 million  commuter rail , French  Intercit\u00e9s  and high-speed  TGV , and international ( Eurostar Thalys ) rail passengers a year as of 2016. [8] [9] [10] Penn Station  in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, is an important railway terminal and transfer hub as well as the busiest railroad station in the  Western Hemisphere , serving more than 430,000  commuter rail  and  Amtrak  passengers a day as of 2018. [11] The world's first recorded railway station was  The Mount  on the Oystermouth Railway (later to be known as the  Swansea and Mumbles ) in  Swansea , Wales, [12]  which began passenger service in 1807, although the trains were horsedrawn rather than by locomotives. [13] \nThe two-storey  Mount Clare station  in  Baltimore Maryland , which survives as a museum, first saw passenger service as the terminus of the horse-drawn  Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  on 22 May 1830. [14] Train station with train and coal depot by  Gustave Le Gray , 1850s to 1860s The oldest terminal station in the world was  Crown Street railway station  in Liverpool, built in 1830, on the locomotive hauled Liverpool to Manchester line. As the first train on the Liverpool-Manchester line left Liverpool, the station is slightly older than the Manchester terminal at Liverpool Road. The station was the first to incorporate a  train shed . The station was demolished in 1836 as the Liverpool terminal station moved to  Lime Street railway station . Crown Street station was converted to a  goods station  terminal.\n The first stations had little in the way of buildings or amenities. The first stations in the modern sense were on the  Liverpool and Manchester Railway , opened in 1830. [15]  Manchester's  Liverpool Road Station , the second oldest terminal station in the world, is preserved as part of the  Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester . It resembles a row of  Georgian  houses.\n Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and goods facilities, though some railway lines were goods-only or passenger-only, and if a line was dual-purpose there would often be a goods depot apart from the passenger station. [16] Dual-purpose stations can sometimes still be found today, though in many cases goods facilities are restricted to major stations.\nIn rural and remote communities across Canada and the United States, passengers wanting to board the train had to flag the train down in order for it to stop. Such stations were known as \" flag stops \" or \"flag stations\". [17] Many stations date from the 19th century and reflect the grandiose architecture of the time, lending prestige to the city as well as to railway operations. [18]  Countries where railways arrived later may still have such architecture, as later stations often imitated 19th-century styles. Various forms of architecture have been used in the construction of stations, from those boasting grand, intricate,  Baroque - or  Gothic -style edifices, to plainer  utilitarian  or  modernist  styles. Stations in Europe tended to follow British designs and were in some countries, like Italy, financed by British railway companies. [19] Stations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports, with a simple, abstract style. Examples of modern stations include those on newer  high-speed rail  networks, such as the  Shinkansen  in Japan,  THSR  in Taiwan,  TGV  lines in France and  ICE  lines in Germany.\n Station facilities edit Stations usually have staffed ticket sales offices, automated  ticket machines , or both, although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains. Many stations include a shop or convenience store. Larger stations usually have  fast-food  or  restaurant  facilities. In some countries, stations may also have a  bar  or  pub . Other station facilities may include:  toilets left-luggage lost-and-found departures and arrivals boards , luggage carts,  waiting rooms taxi ranks bus  bays and even  car parks . Larger or manned stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office. These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost. In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock. A basic station might only have platforms, though it may still be distinguished from a  halt , a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms.\n Many stations, either larger or smaller, offer interchange with local transportation; this can vary from a simple bus stop across the street to underground rapid-transit urban rail stations.\n In many African, South American countries, and Asian countries, stations are also used as a place for public markets and other informal businesses. This is especially true on  tourist  routes or stations near  tourist destinations As well as providing services for passengers and loading facilities for goods, stations can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots (usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs).\n Station configurations edit In addition to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first is the  level of the tracks . Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a  level crossing , the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in  urban areas , except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time.\n Occasionally, a station serves two or more railway lines at differing levels. This may be due to the station's position at a point where two lines cross (example:  Berlin Hauptbahnhof ), or may be to provide separate station capacity for two types of service, such as intercity and suburban (examples:  Paris-Gare de Lyon  and  Philadelphia's 30th Street Station ), or for two different destinations.\n Stations may also be classified according to the layout of the platforms. Apart from single-track lines, the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions; there is then a basic choice of an  island platform  between, or two separate platforms outside, the tracks. With more tracks, the possibilities expand.\n Some stations have unusual platform layouts due to space constraints of the station location, or the alignment of the tracks. Examples include staggered platforms, such as at  Tutbury and Hatton railway station  on the  Crewe\u2013Derby line , and curved platforms, such as  Cheadle Hulme railway station  on the Macclesfield to Manchester Line.  Triangular stations  also exist where two lines form a three-way junction and platforms are built on all three sides, for example  Shipley  and  Earlestown  stations.\n Tracks edit In a station, there are different types of tracks to serve different purposes. A station may also have a  passing loop  with a loop line that comes off the straight  main line  and merge back to the main line on the other end by  railroad switches  to allow trains to pass. [20] A track with a spot at the station to board and disembark trains is called  station track  or  house track [21]  regardless of whether it is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a  platform , the track may be called  platform track . A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called  passing track [20]  A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called  through track [21] There may be other  sidings  at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes. A  maintenance track  or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a passing track, is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service,  autoracks  or  sleepers . A  refuge track  is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train. [20] Terminus edit Opened in 1830 and reached through a tunnel, Liverpool's  Crown Street railway station  was the first ever railway terminus. The station was demolished after only six years, being replaced by  Lime Street station  in the city centre. The tunnel still exists. Opened in 1830,  Liverpool Road station  in  Manchester  is the oldest surviving railway terminus building in the world. Opened in 1836,  Spa Road railway station  in London was the city's first terminus and also the world's first elevated station and terminus. A \"terminus\" or \"terminal\" is a station at the end of a railway line. Trains arriving there have to end their journeys (terminate) or reverse out of the station. Depending on the layout of the station, this usually permits travellers to reach all the  platforms  without the need to cross any  tracks  \u2013 the public entrance to the station and the main reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms.\n Sometimes, however, the track continues for a short distance beyond the station, and terminating trains continue forwards after depositing their passengers, before either proceeding to sidings or reversing to the station to pick up departing passengers.  Bondi Junction  and  Kristiansand Station, Norway  are like this.\n A terminus is frequently, but not always, the final destination of trains arriving at the station. Especially in continental Europe, a city may have a terminus as its main railway station, and all main lines converge on it. In such cases all trains arriving at the terminus must leave in the reverse direction from that of their arrival. There are several ways in which this can be accomplished:\n arranging for the service to be provided by a  multiple-unit  or  push-pull train , both of which are capable of operating in either direction; the driver simply walks to the other end of the train and takes control from the other cab; this is increasingly the normal method in Europe; by detaching the locomotive which brought the train into the station and then either\n using another track to \"run it around\" to the other end of the train, to which it then re-attaches; attaching a second locomotive to the outbound end of the train; or by the use of a \" wye \", a roughly triangular arrangement of track and  switches  (points) where a train can reverse direction and back into the terminal; historically,  turntables  were used to reverse steam engines. There may also be a bypass line, used by freight trains that do not need to stop at the terminus. \n Some termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath (or above, or alongside) the terminal platforms on the main level. They are used by a cross-city extension of the main line, often for  commuter trains , while the terminal platforms may serve long-distance services. Examples of underground through lines include the  Thameslink  platforms at  Blackfriars  in London, the  Argyle  and  North Clyde  lines of  Glasgow's suburban rail network , in  Antwerp  in Belgium, the  RER  at the  Gare du Nord  in Paris, the  Milan suburban railway service 's  Passante railway , and many of the numerous  S-Bahn  lines at terminal stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, such as at  Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof An American example of a terminal with this feature is  Union Station in Washington, DC , where there are bay platforms on the main concourse level to serve terminating trains and standard island platforms one level below to serve trains continuing southwards. The lower tracks run in a tunnel beneath the concourse and emerge a few blocks away to cross the Potomac River into Virginia.\n Terminus stations in large cities are by far the biggest stations, with the largest being the  Grand Central Terminal  in New York City, United States. [22]  Often major cities, such as London,  Boston , Paris,  Istanbul , Tokyo and  Milan   have more than one terminus, rather than routes straight through the city. Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport ( metro bus taxi  or  ferry ) from one terminus to the other. For instance in Istanbul transfers from the  Sirkeci Terminal  (the European terminus) and the  Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal  (the Asian terminus) traditionally required crossing the  Bosphorus  via alternative means, before the  Marmaray  railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed. Some cities, including New York, have both termini and through lines.\n Terminals that have competing rail lines using the station frequently set up a jointly owned  terminal railroad  to own and operate the station and its associated tracks and switching operations.\n Junction edit Vijayawada , a railway junction in  India [23] unreliable source? Main article:  Junction (rail) A  junction  is a station where two or more rail routes converge or diverge. It could be either a terminus or an en-route station.\n Stop edit During a journey, the term  station stop  may be used in announcements, to differentiate a halt during which passengers may alight for another reason, such as a  locomotive change A  railway stop  is a spot along a  railway line , usually between stations or at a seldom-used station, where  passengers  can board and exit the  train While a junction or  interlocking  usually divides two or more lines or routes, and thus has remotely or locally operated  signals , a station stop does not. A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks, and may or may not have  switches  (points, crossovers).\n Halt edit See also:  Request stop A  halt , in railway parlance in the  Commonwealth of Nations  and  Republic of Ireland , is a small station, usually unstaffed or with very few staff, and with few or no facilities. In some cases, trains stop only on  request , when passengers on the platform indicate that they wish to board, or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish to alight.\n St Keyne Wishing Well Halt In the United Kingdom, most former halts on the national railway networks have had the word  halt  removed from their names. Historically, in many instances the spelling \"halte\" was used, before the spelling \"halt\" became commonplace. There are only two publicly advertised and publicly accessible National Rail stations with the word \"halt\" remaining:  Coombe Junction Halt  and  St Keyne Wishing Well Halt [24] [25]  In addition there are a number of other such stops in the UK rail network such as  Penmaenmawr  in North Wales, where passengers are requested to inform a member of on-board train staff if they wish to alight, or, if catching a train from the station, to make themselves clearly visible to the driver and use a hand signal as the train approaches. [26] A number of other halts are still open and operational on privately owned, heritage, and preserved railways throughout the British Isles. The word is often used informally to describe national rail network stations with limited service and low usage, such as the  Oxfordshire Halts  on the  Cotswold Line . The title halt had also sometimes been applied colloquially to stations served by public services but not available for use by the general public, being accessible only by persons travelling to/from an associated factory (for example IBM near Greenock \u2013 although this is no longer restricted \u2013 and  British Steel Redcar ), military base (such as  Lympstone Commando ) or railway yard.  The only two such remaining \"private\" stopping places on the national system where the \"halt\" designation is still officially used seem to be Staff Halt (at Durnsford Road, Wimbledon) and Battersea Pier Sidings Staff Halt \u2013 both are solely for railway staff and are  not  open to passengers. [25] The  Great Western Railway  in Great Britain began opening  haltes  on 12 October 1903; from 1905, the French spelling was Anglicised to \"halt\". These GWR halts had the most basic facilities, with platforms long enough for just one or two carriages; some had no raised platform at all, necessitating the provision of steps on the carriages. Halts were normally unstaffed, tickets being sold on the train. On 1 September 1904, a larger version, known on the GWR as a \"platform\" instead of a \"halt\", was introduced; these had longer platforms, and were usually staffed by a senior grade porter, who sold tickets, and sometimes booked parcels or milk consignments. [27] [28] From 1903 to 1947 the GWR built 379 halts and inherited a further 40 from other companies at the  Grouping  of 1923. Peak building periods were before the  First World War  (145 built) and 1928\u201339 (198 built) [29] ). Ten more were opened by  BR  on ex-GWR lines. The GWR also built 34 \"platforms\". [30] In many  Commonwealth  countries the term \"halt\" is still used. In the United States such stations are traditionally referred to as  flag stops . In Germany, the term is  Haltepunkt Hp In the  Republic of Ireland , a few small railway stations are designated as \"halts\" ( Irish stadanna , sing.  stad [31] In  Victoria, Australia , a  rail motor stopping place RMSP ) is a location on a railway line where a small passenger vehicle or  railmotor  can stop to allow passengers to alight. It is often designated by just a sign beside the railway [32]  at a convenient access point near a road. The passenger can hail the train driver to stop, and buy a ticket from the guard or the conductor on the train. [33] Accessibility edit Accessibility for people with disabilities is mandated by law in some countries.  Considerations include: elevator or ramp access to all platforms, matching platform height to train floors, making wheelchair lifts available when platforms do not match vehicle floors, accessible toilets and pay phones, audible station announcements, and safety measures such as tactile marking of platform edges.\n Goods stations edit Reached by a 1.24-mile (2\u00a0km) long tunnel, the 1830  Park Lane Goods Terminus  at Liverpool's docks was the world's first station built entirely for freight. Main article:  Goods station Goods or freight stations deal exclusively or predominantly with the loading and unloading of goods and may well have  marshalling yards  (classification yards) for the sorting of wagons.  The world's first goods terminal was the 1830  Park Lane Goods Station  at the South End Liverpool Docks. Built in 1830, the terminal was reached by a 1.24-mile (2\u00a0km) tunnel.\n As goods are increasingly moved by road, many former goods stations, as well as the goods sheds at passenger stations, have closed. In addition, many goods stations today are used purely for the cross-loading of freight and may be known as transshipment stations, where they primarily handle containers. They are also known as container stations or terminals.\n Largest, busiest and highest stations edit @media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .mobile-float-reset{float:none!important;width:100%!important}}.mw-parser-output .stack-container{box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .stack-clear-left{float:left;clear:left}.mw-parser-output .stack-clear-right{float:right;clear:right}.mw-parser-output .stack-left{float:left}.mw-parser-output .stack-right{float:right}.mw-parser-output .stack-object{margin:1px;overflow:hidden} Grand Central Terminal  in New York City is the largest station by number of platforms, with 44 on two levels.

OpenStreetMap  of Central London. Central London  (also known less commonly as  London city centre ) is the innermost part of  London , in the United Kingdom, spanning several boroughs.  Over time, a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government.  Its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. \n Road distances to London are traditionally measured from a central point at  Charing Cross  (in the  City of Westminster ), which is marked by the  statue of King Charles I  at the junction of the  Strand Whitehall  and  Cockspur Street , just south of  Trafalgar Square [1] Contents 1 Characteristics 2 Definitions 2.1 London Plan 2.2 1901 Census 2.3 1959\u20131963 proposals for a central London borough 3 References Characteristics edit The central area is distinguished, according to the  Royal Commission , by the inclusion within its boundaries of  Parliament  and the Royal Palaces, the headquarters of Government, the  Law Courts , the head offices of a very large number of commercial and industrial firms, as well as institutions of great influence in the intellectual life of the nation such as the  British Museum , the  National Gallery , the  Tate Gallery , the  University of London , the headquarters of the national ballet and opera, together with the headquarters of many national associations, the great professions, the trade unions, the trade associations, social service societies, as well as shopping centres and centres of entertainment which attract people from the whole of  Greater London  and farther afield.\n In many other respects the central area differs from areas farther out in London. The  rateable value  of the central area is exceptionally high. Its day population is very much larger than its night population. Its traffic problems reach an intensity not encountered anywhere else in the Metropolis or in any provincial city, and the enormous office developments which have taken place recently constitute a totally new phenomenon.\n Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) .

[2]  It is described as \"a unique cluster of vitally important activities including central government offices, headquarters and embassies, the largest concentration of London's financial and business services sector and the offices of trade, professional bodies, institutions, associations, communications, publishing, advertising and the media\". [3] For strategic planning, since 2011 there has been a Central London  sub-region  comprising the boroughs of  Camden Islington Kensington and Chelsea Lambeth Southwark Westminster  and the  City of London [4]  From 2004 to 2008, the London Plan included a sub-region called Central London comprising Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark,  Wandsworth  and Westminster. [5]  It had a 2001 population of 1,525,000. The sub-region was replaced in 2008 with a new structure which amalgamated inner and outer boroughs together. This was altered in 2011 when a new Central London sub-region was created, now including the City of London and excluding Wandsworth. However, districts at the outer edge of this subregion such as Streatham and Dulwich are not generally considered as Central London.\n 1901 Census edit The 1901 census defined Central London as the  City of London  and the metropolitan boroughs of  Bermondsey Bethnal Green Finsbury Holborn Shoreditch Southwark Stepney St Marylebone  and  Westminster [6] 1959\u20131963 proposals for a central London borough edit During the  Herbert Commission  and the subsequent passage of the  London Government Bill , three unsuccessful attempts were made to define an area that would form a central  London borough . The first two were detailed in the 1959 Memorandum of Evidence of the  Greater London Group  of the  London School of Economics \"Scheme A\" envisaged a central London borough, one of 25, consisting of the City of London, Westminster, Holborn, Finsbury and the inner parts of St Marylebone, St Pancras, Chelsea, Southwark and Lambeth. The boundary deviated from existing lines to include all  central London railway stations , the  Tower of London  and the museums, such that it included small parts of Kensington, Shoreditch, Stepney and Bermondsey. It had an estimated population of 350,000 and occupied 7,000 acres (28\u00a0km 2 [7] \"Scheme B\" delineated central London, as one of 7 boroughs, including most of the City of London, the whole of Finsbury and Holborn, most of Westminster and Southwark, parts of St Pancras, St Marylebone, Paddington and a small part of Kensington. The area had an estimated population of 400,000 and occupied 8,000 acres (32\u00a0km 2 [7] During the passage of the London Government Bill an amendment was put forward to create a central borough corresponding to the definition used at the 1961 census. It consisted of the City of London, all of Westminster, Holborn and Finsbury; and the inner parts of Shoreditch, Stepney, Bermondsey, Southwark, Lambeth, Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, St Marylebone and St Pancras. The population was estimated to be 270,000.

Jump to navigation Jump to search Pentonville Road, west of  The Angel, Islington , looking towards  King's Cross Pentonville Road  is a road in  Central London  that runs west to east from  Kings Cross  to  City Road  at  The Angel, Islington . The road is part of the  London Inner Ring Road  and part of the boundary of the  London congestion charge  zone.\n The road was originally built in the mid-18th century as part of the  New Road , a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the  new town  of  Pentonville , that encouraged manufacturing to move out of the city and into suburbia. Numerous factories and commercial premises became established on the road in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.\n As industrial manufacturing fell out of favour in London in the late 20th century, many properties are now residential or student accommodation. Current premises include the Crafts Council Gallery on the site of a former chapel, the  Scala  nightclub in a former cinema, and The Castle, a public house.\n Contents 1 Geography 2 History 3 Properties 4 Cultural references 5 See also 6 References Geography edit The road is 0.7 miles (1.1\u00a0km) long and runs east from  King's Cross station  as a continuation of  Euston Road . It ends at the  Angel, Islington , at a junction with  Islington High Street  and Goswell Road; the road ahead becoming  City Road . Only eastbound traffic can travel on the full extent of the road; westbound traffic is diverted south via Swinton Street. The road is on the  London Inner Ring Road  (A501) and as such forms part of the boundary of the  London congestion charge  zone. [1]  Since 1995, it has been a  red route , prohibiting stopping of any kind, including loading and unloading. [2] Most of the road is in the  London Borough of Islington  but a small part near Kings Cross is in the  London Borough of Camden , including the  King's Cross Thameslink railway station  and the \"Lighthouse\" Block. [3] London Underground  and  National Rail  stations in the vicinity include Kings Cross and  Angel Underground station [1] There has been a bus service on Pentonville Road since 1829. [4]  Regular bus routes running along the road are 30, 73 and 146. [5] History edit A westward view along Pentonville Road, drawn in 1884 by  John O'Connor What is now Pentonville Road was built as the final section of the  New Road  in 1756, connecting the  City of London  to the western suburbs, so that coach traffic could avoid Central London. [4] [6]  At the time, the route now covered by Pentonville Road was mostly fields, with  Battle Bridge  occupying the space where King's Cross now is. [7]  It included a tavern known as  Busby's Folly , a meeting place of a drinking group known as the Society of Bull Feathers. It is marked on  John Ogilby 's map of London in 1675. It was moved around 1780 to Penton Street and renamed the Belvedere Tavern. The current building dates from 1876. [8] The road was designed as part of  Pentonville , a new suburb away from the City and became a local hub for manufacturing in the area. [9]  There was some debate over the final route of the road; the original plan to run straight through fields owned by the  Skinners Company  and the  New River Company  was rejected in favour of the route further north via Battle Bridge. [4]  As it was always intended to be a main road, a coach service began in 1798 between  Paddington  and  Bank  but was quickly withdrawn. The road was  turnpiked  in 1830 and renamed Pentonville Road after landowner Henry Penton in 1857. Until 1882, the upkeep of the road was paid by the local parish, paying a ground rent to Penton's estate for the disused toll house at No.\u00a0274. [4] The street is distinguished by the \"set back\" housing lines originally intended to provide an atmosphere of spaciousness along the thoroughfare. [10]  The original 1756 act to create the New Road prohibited the construction of any building within 50 feet (15\u00a0m) of its side. [11]  Though the area had been designed to be a pleasant suburb, the arrival of railways in the 1840s turned the road into an industrial urban street, with factories and workshops aligning the road. [10]  The original bylaw restricting property on the front of the road was ignored and shops were built on top of gardens. [12] By the 21st century, most of the manufacturing base along Pentonville Road had disappeared. The original townhouses are now apartments. [13] Properties edit The Lighthouse Block, at Nos.\u00a0295\u2013297 Pentonville Road, is named after the distinctive structure at the top of the building. Alexander Cumming, former clockmaker and organ builder to  Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll , built a house at No.\u00a0166 Pentonville Road. In 1807, the year after his death, the house became the London Female Penitentiary, housing \" fallen women \" and rehabilitating them into society. It was extended between 1811\u201312, roughly tripling its capacity, and moved to  Stoke Newington  in 1884. [4] The Thomas S. Jones  organ  builders were based at No.\u00a025 Pentonville Road between 1860 and 1935. [10]  The Dunn & Hewett cocoa factory was established at No.\u00a09 Pentonville Road in 1833 by Daniel Dunn, who went into partnership with Charles Hewett in the 1850s. The business claimed to have invented soluble chocolate and cocoa, and moved to No.\u00a0136, expanding to No.\u00a0138 in the 1870s. The building was enlarged and partially rebuilt over the 1880s and 90s, and included a staff tea-room at No.\u00a0140 by 1907. The factory closed around 1930 and was subsequently sub-let to various businesses. The Ealing Radiator Company was established at Nos.\u00a0152\u2013154 Pentonville Road in 1936, manufacturing  car radiators . A first floor extension was added in 1952, while Nos.\u00a0136\u2013150 were cleared to accommodate a low metal-framed building. [7]  These premises have now been sub-let to various businesses. [14] The  Scala  was previously the King's Cross Cinema, established on Pentonville Road in 1920. The Claremont Chapel was at No.\u00a044a Pentonville Road. It was named after  Claremont House , home of the then-recently deceased  Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales . The chapel was designed by Thomas Wilson, who acquired the 2 acre site in 1818 for \u00a3700, spending an additional \u00a36,000 on building works. It opened in October 1819, though a regular pastor was not appointed until 1822. The building was extended in 1847 to accommodate a Sunday school, while  sash windows  were installed in 1853. In 1860, the building was refurbished and given a Classical facade, but reducing the capacity of the inside gallery. Attendance declined and the chapel was sold to the London Congregational Union, before closing in 1899. It re-opened in 1902 as Claremont Hall, a mission institute. It was let for commercial purposes in the 1960s, and sub-let to the Crafts Council in 1991. [7]  The building is now the Crafts Council Gallery, a public gallery funded by the  Arts Council England . It contains a number of exhibition rooms that are available for use. [15] The block of properties at No.\u00a0295\u2013297 Pentonville Road, at its junction with Gray's Inn Road, is known as the \"Lighthouse Block\" owing to the lead clad tower at the top of the building. [16]  The site avoided being  compulsory purchased  and demolished (in order to provide improvements to King's Cross station's eastern entrance) and is now Grade II listed. [16] [17] The Vernon Square school opened on Pentonville Road in 1913, expanding to cover secondary school students in 1949. It was renamed the  Sir Philip Magnus  School in 1952 and closed in the 1970s. It became part of  Kingsway College  before being purchased by the  School of Oriental and African Studies  in 2001. [18]  The SOAS has several other halls of residence along Pentonville Road, including Dinwiddy House. [19] The Castle, a pub on Pentonville Road, achieved notoriety in 2015 when it was discovered the  Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary  was discussed there by the perpetrators. The Lexington  is a music venue at Nos.\u00a096-98. It has played host to local bands, and as a warm-up venue for more established acts. [20]  The  Scala  at No.\u00a0275\u2013277 Pentonville Road opened as the King's Cross Cinema in 1920 with a capacity of 1,300. Construction had begun just before  World War I  and was halted because of it. It was damaged by bombs during  World War II , and while it remained open during wartime, it eventually had to be shut between 1949 and 1952 for renovations and repair. It closed in 1970, and re-opened as an independent cinema, [21]  which showed old  16mm films  including  King Kong [22] The Stooges  played their only gig in London at the venue in June 1972, shortly before recording the album  Raw Power  with  David Bowie ; a shot of  Iggy Pop  onstage here became the album's front cover. [23]  The venue closed in 1992, and is now a nightclub. [22] The Castle is a pub at No.\u00a054 Pentonville Road, at the junction with Baron Street. In 2015, the perpetrators of the  Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary  met at the pub to discuss the crime shortly after it occurred, but were secretly filmed there by the  Flying Squad . All were subsequently arrested and sent to prison. The current owners, Geronimo Inns, wish to distance themselves from the burglary and forbid staff to discuss it with customers. [24] The original  Angel, Islington , sits at the far east end of Pentonville Road, at its junction with Islington High Street. It was named after the  Angel of the Annunciation  that appeared on its sign. [6]  The inn pre-dated the construction of Pentonville Road, and had become one of the largest coaching inns in the local area by the 18th century. [25]  The site was cut in two by the construction of the road, with the inn remaining on the north side. A new building was constructed in 1899, later becoming a Lyons Corner House. It closed in 1959, and was threatened with demolition as a plan to improve junction improvements around Pentonville Road, but survived and is now partly occupied by a branch of  The Co-operative Bank [26] Cultural references edit The poet  John Betjeman 's parents ran a cabinet makers at No.\u00a034\u201342 Pentonville Road. It was established since 1859 and produced the  Tantalus  drinks cabinet in 1881. [7] Pentonville Road is one of the locations on the London version of the  Monopoly board game . It is one of the light blue squares alongside The Angel, Islington and  Euston Road , both of which it connects to. [6]  The magazine  Mixmag s main offices are at Nos.\u00a090\u201392 Pentonville Road. [27] See also edit Joseph Grimaldi Park References edit Citations a b \"Pentonville Road\" . Google Maps .

here. For the VIA Rail station in London, Ontario, Canada, see  London railway station (Ontario) . For other uses, see  London railway station (disambiguation) London terminal stations. Clockwise from top left:  Euston King's Cross Liverpool Street London Bridge Waterloo  and  Paddington The  London station group  is a  group  of 18 railway stations served by the  National Rail  network in  central London . Most are  terminal stations , either serving major national services or local commuter routes. A small number are through-stations that are considered terminals for ticketing purposes. All current stations in the group fall within  London fare zone 1 . A ticket marked \"London Terminals\" allows travel to any station in the group via any permitted route, as determined by the  National Routeing Guide Most London terminal stations were developed in the mid-19th century during the initial boom of rail transport. Many stations were built around the edge of central London, stopping at what is now the  London Inner Ring Road , because it was prohibitively expensive to build right into the centre, and because each railway was owned by a private company competing with the others. The creation of the  London Underground  provided a practical connection to the various termini, which continues to be the case as of the 21st century. Many of the stations have been upgraded and modernised to provide a greater capacity and connections to the network; the first London terminus,  London Bridge  has been rebuilt and expanded on numerous occasions, and of the major 19th century terminals, only  Broad Street  has closed.\n The London terminals had a significant impact on the local area. Originally, the demolition of poor properties, particularly south of the  River Thames , caused blight and deprived areas around the station. This has changed in the 21st century, where development around the main terminals has been well-received and attracted occupants and businesses.\n Contents 1 Definition 2 Background 3 Cultural impact 4 Group members 4.1 Current stations 4.2 Former stations 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Definition edit Various  APTIS  tickets showing the variation in \"London\" Until 1970, railway tickets to London were issued to a specific named terminus.  From April of that year, the nine  Southern Region  termini south of the River Thames were grouped together as a \"notional common station\" called \"LONDON S.R.\"; tickets issued to this destination were valid to Blackfriars, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Holborn Viaduct, London Bridge, Vauxhall, Victoria, Waterloo and Waterloo East. [1]   The concept was extended to the rest of London's termini with effect from  British Rail 's fares update of May 1983, when the London station group was created: \"as part of the progress towards simplification of routes and a reduction of [separate fares] ... a common origin/destination of LONDON BR has been adopted for most London fares\". [2]   Tickets to the London station group were issued to \"LONDON BR\" until January 1989, when the name \"LONDON BRIT RAIL\" was adopted. [3]   After the  privatisation of British Rail , the name \"LONDON\" on its own was used from the end of 1997 [4]  until April 1998, when the present designation \"LONDON TERMINALS\" was introduced. [5] All stations in the London group are in  London fare zone 1  and most are at the end of a railway line. This includes major national terminals such as  Waterloo Paddington Euston  and  King's Cross , and local commuter terminals such as  Cannon Street  and  Moorgate . In addition, the group includes four stations ( City Thameslink Old Street Vauxhall  and  Waterloo East ) that are not technically termini but are used enough as a destination by National Rail to be considered appropriate as a \"London Terminal\" for ticketing purposes. [6] [7] [a]   The composition of the group has changed several times since 1983, when 18 stations were included: Blackfriars, Broad Street, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Euston, Fenchurch Street, Holborn Viaduct, Kings Cross, Kings Cross Midland City, Liverpool Street, London Bridge, Marylebone, Moorgate, Paddington, St Pancras, Vauxhall, Victoria and Waterloo. [2]   Waterloo East was included separately from January 1984. [8]   Two years later, Moorgate was dropped from the group in favour of Old Street, and Kensington Olympia was included; [9]  this was in connection with its upgrade in early 1986 to an  InterCity  station with regular British Rail services from northwest England to the south coast. [10] [11]   Moorgate was reinstated as a member of the group in May 1988, [12]  and Kensington Olympia was removed from the list in May 1994 as British Rail decided to make fares to and from the station identical to those of neighbouring station  Willesden Junction [13] Tickets issued to \"LONDON TERMINALS\" can be used to travel from the station of origin to any London terminus that can be reached via a permitted route as defined by the  National Routeing Guide .  For example, a journey from  Brighton  can use such a ticket to take a train to several different London terminals, including  London Bridge Victoria Blackfriars , City Thameslink or Waterloo via  Clapham Junction [6]   The ticket cannot be used to travel to any station using any non-National Rail modes of transport, including the  London Underground Docklands Light Railway  or  London Buses . Therefore, a journey from Brighton cannot use a \"London Terminals\" ticket to travel to Euston or Paddington, as there is no permitted route to them using National Rail services alone. [6] [14]   The concept of permitted routes did not exist until the National Routeing Guide was introduced: British Rail used the term \"reasonable route\", and in respect of the London station group merely stated that journeys between the origin station and London were \"subject to normal route availabilities\". [8] Background edit The first London terminal station,  London Bridge , in 1836 The first London terminal stations were built in the late 1830s (starting with London Bridge in 1836) and the early to mid 1840s. Those north of the Thames came up to the edge of richly-developed property that was too expensive to demolish, while property south of the river contained slums and cheap property, making it easier to have terminal stations close to the City and West End, both the main desired areas. [15]  The solicitor and railway planner  Charles Pearson  proposed a main central station at  Farringdon , which would connect out to all branch lines. [16]  In 1846, the  Royal Commission on Metropolitan Railway Termini  was established to see if it was appropriate to bring the terminal stations any further and possibly connect with each other, as per Pearson's plans. The report concluded this was unnecessary, a single terminus was undesirable as it would create too much congestion and it was too expensive to demolish remaining property in the way. [17] [18] The Royal Commission recommended that no new stations should be built in the  West End of London  or the City, and that the  New Road  should be the northern boundary of railway development. [15] [18]  This created competition between the individual railway companies, who could promote new termini with individual financial backers. [19]  Exemptions were made for the  Great Eastern Railway  and  North London Railway  with  Liverpool Street  and  Broad Street  respectively. [20]  The only main railway line built across Central London was the  London, Chatham and Dover Railway  (LCDR) line connecting Blackfriars to Farringdon via  Snow Hill Tunnel  in 1866. [21] The distinctive Gothic architecture of  St Pancras railway station  survived demolition, unlike neighbouring  Euston Railway construction in London reached a peak between the mid-1850s and 1870s, where an estimated \u00a340 million (\u00a33,648 million as of 2018) was spent constructing routes around the capital. The competition between termini led to increased costs and financial overruns. Around \u00a32 million (\u00a3182 million as of 2018) was spent constructing the final approach of the GER main line from the original terminus at  Bishopsgate  to Liverpool Street, while the extension from London Bridge to Cannon Street and  Charing Cross  cost \u00a34 million (\u00a3365 million as of 2018). The construction of the LCDR's line via Blackfriars and Farringdon almost bankrupted the company and left it in financial ruin for the rest of its existence. [22]  The 1864  Joint Committee  on Railway Schemes (Metropolis) decided that, following the success of the underground  Metropolitan Railway , that a circular railway should be built to connect the terminals, which eventually became the  Circle line , though it was not completed until 1884. [23] By 1870, the boom in building London terminals had finished. [24]  The final one to open was the  Great Central Railway 's  Marylebone , in 1899. [25]  By this time, around 776 acres (1.21 square miles; 3.14 square kilometres), or 5.4% of land in the central zone of London was owned by railway companies, more than the  Corporation of London [26] [27] Broad Street station  was one of the few in the London station group to be closed and demolished. The problem of connecting the various London terminals was ultimately resolved by the development of the Underground. The Metropolitan Railway, which opened in 1863, was designed to connect Paddington with King's Cross. [28]  The Circle Line was designed specifically to connect the London terminals together. [29]  All terminal stations had at least one underground connection by 1913, except  Fenchurch Street Ludgate Hill  and  Holborn Viaduct [30]  As an alternative to the tube, buses have connected the various terminals. In 1928, the  Southern Railway London and North Eastern Railway  and  Great Western Railway  began to provide dedicated buses between their termini for  Pullman  and Continental trains. These were taken over by the  London Passenger Transport Board  (LPTB) upon its formation in 1933, and replaced with regular bus services. From 1936, the LPTB supplied purpose-build 20-seater coaches for this services, with large luggage boots and a flat fare of 1/- (\u00a33.34 as of 2018). These were suspended during  World War II . All stations except Fenchurch Street and Blackfriars provided integrated taxi services on opening. These originally had dedicated access roads to the station platforms when cabs were horse-drawn, while later purpose-built roads were built for road traffic. [31] In the early 20th century, stations were expanded and upgraded to fit demand. [32]  Six terminal stations (Victoria, Waterloo, Euston, Cannon Street, Blackfriars and London Bridge) have been completely rebuilt and London Bridge has seen multiple rebuilds. [33]  While some of the stations had impressive facades and entrances, these were gradually neglected, such as the  Euston Arch  which was demolished in 1962 as part of modernisation works to the station, while the area around Kings Cross became run-down. [34]  An important exception was the Victorian Gothic structure of  St Pancras , which became a Grade I  listed building  in 1967 after being threatened with demolition. [35] [36]  Similarly, King's Cross and Paddington became Grade I listed in 1954 and 1961 respectively. [37] [38] In 1986, Broad Street, which had been a major London terminus for local and commuter services, closed. [39]  It was feared that Marylebone and St Pancras would follow, but both have been revitalised; the former became an alternative terminus for services to  Oxford  and  Birmingham [40]  while the latter is now the main entry point for  Eurostar  services via the  Channel Tunnel [41] Cultural impact edit The building of railway lines into London took up a substantial amount of land, particularly south of the Thames. The various terminal stations began to affect their surrounding area once built. Those displaced by the railways crammed into whatever existing accommodation was available, creating slums, and the immediate area around the stations were filled with cheap souvenir shops and prostitutes. Conversely, the middle class moved out into suburbs which now had easy access to Central London via train, and railway traffic increased. [42]  Around 76,000 people lost their homes between 1853 and 1901 as a direct result of rail expansion. [43]  The area around Waterloo had already become notorious for prostitution by the time the station was built, which was eventually cleared away in 1867 when the  London and South Western Railway  made a  compulsory purchase order  for the properties and demolished them, to accommodate an expanded station. [44]  A significant exception was the later-constructed Marylebone, while Charing Cross was less affected by slum building than neighbouring stations. [42] Around  Battersea  and  New Cross , railway lines and interchanges occupied about 300 acres (120\u00a0ha) of available space. The low-income property that was destroyed by building the stations was generally not replaced, and consequently the remaining accommodation became overcrowded. [24]  The proliferation of railway lines south of the Thames is why the Underground has more lines north of the river, as it did not have alternative overground services. [45] In contrast to the 19th century impact of stations, newer developments have seen  gentrification  of the areas around them. Both Kings Cross and St Pancras stations have been modernised in the 21st century, and are now better regarded. Many goods sheds have been removed, and the area surrounding the stations includes a natural swimming pool, and numerous new apartments. [46] [47] The four former London and North Eastern Railway terminals (King's Cross, Marylebone, Fenchurch Street and Liverpool Street) are the stations on a standard British  Monopoly  board.

Additional services to  East Grinstead  and  Littlehampton  operate at peak times. The network opened as a through service in 1988, with severe overcrowding by 1998, carrying more than 28,000 passengers in the morning peak. All the services are currently operated by  Govia Thameslink Railway The  Thameslink Programme  is a major \u00a35.5\u00a0billion scheme to increase capacity on the central London section by accommodating more frequent and longer trains. The upgrade is scheduled for completion in 2019. In 2016, new  Class 700  trains started operating on the route and have now replaced the  Class 319 Class 377  and  Class 387  trains which were withdrawn and transferred elsewhere.\n Contents 1 Route 2 Services 3 History 4 Thameslink Programme 5 Rolling stock 5.1 Fleet 6 2014 franchise 7 Thameslink 2 8 See also 9 Notes 10 References 11 Further reading 12 External links Route edit Much of the original route is over the  Brighton Main Line  (via London Bridge) and the southern part of the  Midland Main Line , with a suburban loop through Sutton and Wimbledon. A branch via the  Catford Loop Line  to Sevenoaks was added in 2012. Sections to  Peterborough  on the  East Coast Main Line Cambridge  via the  Cambridge Line Horsham  on the  Arun Valley line  and  Rainham  via  Greenwich  were added in 2018.  East Grinstead  and  Littlehampton  are also served in peak hours.\n The route through central London is via  St Pancras International  for connections to  Eurostar  and the East Midlands;  Farringdon , for  London Underground Circle Metropolitan  and  Hammersmith & City  lines, and soon  Crossrail City Thameslink , which replaced the demolished  Holborn Viaduct station  and has a southern entrance serving Ludgate Circus;  Blackfriars , for main-line rail services and the Underground  District  and Circle lines; and  London Bridge  for main-line links into Kent and Sussex and the Underground  Northern  and  Jubilee  lines.  King's Cross Thameslink  on  Pentonville Road  closed on 8 December 2007.\n Trains operating the \"main line\" service (Bedford to Brighton, Peterborough to Horsham) include first-class accommodation; those operating from Luton, St Albans and Kentish Town to Sutton, Sevenoaks and Orpington are usually standard class only. [2]  When  Govia  operated the  original Thameslink franchise  these services were designated \"Thameslink CityFlier\" and \"Thameslink CityMetro\" respectively, but  First Capital Connect  dropped this branding.  Govia Thameslink Railway  now refers to these services as Route TL1 (formerly Route 6) and Route TL2/TL3 (formerly Route 7/8) respectively.\n Services edit .mw-parser-output .RMbox{box-shadow:0 2px

 Snow Hill Tunnel  from mid-Victorian times until  World War I , when services terminated at Moorgate from the Midland line to the north, and at Holborn Viaduct from the south, at a time when most inner cross-London traffic had been lost to buses and trams. There were low-level platforms under the main part of Holborn Viaduct station known as the Snow Hill platforms: these can still be seen when leaving City Thameslink station travelling northwards.\n On 14 June 1941 railwayman George Dow proposed in an article in the London evening newspaper  The Star  that new routes be built in tunnels from Marylebone south to Victoria, and from King's Cross south to Charing Cross.  Both were to connect with a Paddington\u2013Liverpool Street tunnel that he proposed, anticipating Crossrail by 40\u00a0years. He also proposed a north-east/south- west route from Liverpool Street to Charing Cross,  all designed to give London a comprehensive main-line network of connections. [3] The Snow Hill Tunnel route remained open for cross-London freight trains until 1970, when the short section between Farringdon and Holborn Viaduct was closed.\n Overhead electrification, completed in 1982, allowed the northern section to run as the  Midland City Line  from  Bedford  via the  Midland Main Line  to  St Pancras , and via the  City Widened Lines  to  Moorgate [4] The  Snow Hill tunnel  was re-opened by  British Rail  to passenger trains after 72\u00a0years, with Thameslink beginning in May 1988. [5]  On 29 January 1990 the section between Blackfriars and Farringdon was temporarily closed to permit the construction of a new alignment. The route through the site of the long-closed Ludgate Hill station, over Ludgate Hill to  Holborn Viaduct  was abandoned and demolished. The replacement route under Ludgate Hill was opened on 29 May 1990 by the  Network SouthEast  (sector of  British Rail ) concurrently with  City Thameslink  station, which was initially called St Paul's Thameslink but was renamed in 1991 to avoid confusion with  St. Paul's station  on the Underground (Central line), about 500\u00a0m (550\u00a0yd) away.\n King's Cross Thameslink  on  Pentonville Road  closed on 8 December 2007 when the Thameslink platforms at nearby  St Pancras  opened.\n In the south the services divide: main-line trains run through  London Bridge  to  East Croydon  and  Brighton , but the other route has a more convoluted history. In 1988\u201391 trains went via Bromley to Orpington and Sevenoaks, and via Herne Hill and East Croydon to Purley (off peak only). Later, non-Brighton trains ran via  Elephant & Castle  and  Streatham  to  West Croydon Carshalton Beeches Sutton Epsom Leatherhead  and  Effingham Junction , to  Guildford On the  privatisation of British Rail , Thameslink was franchised to  Thameslink , a subsidiary of  Govia Around 1994 the second branch was cut back to West Croydon as this route crossed the commuter networks of what were to become several different rail companies, and  rail privatisation  made the route increasingly difficult to maintain.\n Around 1995 the route was changed completely, with a route to  Sutton  via  Mitcham Junction  continuing on a  loop to Wimbledon  rejoining itself south of Streatham replacing the West Croydon service.\n By late 1998, more than 28,000 passengers were carried at morning peak times. [6] From 1 April 2006 the franchise was taken over by  First Capital Connect  along with some services previously operated by  WAGN [7]  The branding of most trains, stations, and signs was changed to match the name of the new company, but  City Thameslink  and  West Hampstead Thameslink  were not renamed as  Thameslink  referred to the route. [8]  After criticism of the loss of the apt name for this group of routes, [9]  First Capital Connect's publicity began calling this set of services its \"Thameslink route\" to distinguish it from the former WAGN services.\n On 14 September 2014, Govia Thameslink Railway took over operations from  First Capital Connect [10] Thameslink Programme edit Main article:  Thameslink Programme St Pancras International Thameslink platforms opened in 2007 Blackfriars  new cross-river platforms Following the success of the original scheme, plans were drawn up to upgrade the network to cope with the increasing passenger numbers that have led to severe peak-time overcrowding. [11]  Network Rail obtained planning permission and legal powers in 2006, [12]  funding was secured in July 2007 [13]  and construction began in October 2007. [14]  Plans included rebuilding the station buildings at Farringdon (in conjunction with the  Crossrail  project) and West Hampstead Thameslink, total rebuild of  London Bridge  and  Blackfriars  stations, two new underground platforms at St Pancras International, a new tunnel north of St Pancras International to the  East Coast Main Line  to allow through services to Peterborough and Cambridge in 2017, and platform lengthening, now being completed. A new 8 and 12 carriage fleet of Class 700 trains began entering service in 2016.\n The London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy published in July 2011 lays out a provisional 24tph timetable. South of London it would provide four trains to Brighton (one semi-fast, one stopping) and two each to Three Bridges, Horsham, East Grinstead, Caterham, Tattenham Corner, Tunbridge Wells, Ashford International, Maidstone East, Sevenoaks and Bellingham. North of London there would be eight semi-fast trains to Bedford, four stopping trains to St Albans, two stopping and two semi-fast trains to Luton, two semi-fast trains to Peterborough, two semi-fast trains to Cambridge and four stopping trains to Welwyn Garden City. [15] Below is a provisional timetable for Thameslink once the upgrade is complete.\n Mainline No.\n Northern terminus\n Central London\n Southern terminus\n Length\n Times (core)\n 1\n Bedford semi-fast\n via  London Bridge Brighton fast\n 12-car\n All day\n 2\n 3\n Bedford semi-fast\n via  London Bridge Gatwick Airport  (via Redhill)\n semi-fast\n 12-car\n All day\n 4\n 5\n Peterborough semi-fast\n via  London Bridge Horsham  (via Redhill)\n semi-fast\n 12-car\n All day [a] 6\n 7\n Cambridge semi-fast\n via  London Bridge Brighton fast\n 12-car\n All day [a] 8\n 9\n Cambridge stopping\n via  London Bridge Maidstone East [b] semi-fast\n 8-car\n All day [c] 10\n 11\n Bedford fast\n via  London Bridge East Grinstead stopping\n 12-car\n Peak only\n 12\n 13\n Bedford fast\n via  London Bridge Littlehampton  (via Hove)\n fast\n 12-car\n Peak only\n 14\n Metro No.\n Northern terminus\n Central London\n Southern terminus\n Length\n Times\n 15\n Luton all stations [d] via  London Bridge Rainham  (via Greenwich)\n all stations [e] 8-car\n All day\n 16\n 17\n St Albans City all stations\n via  Elephant & Castle Sutton  (via Mitcham Junction)\n all stations\n 8-car\n All day\n 18\n 19\n St Albans City all stations\n via  Elephant & Castle Sutton  (via Wimbledon)\n all stations\n 8-car\n All day\n 20\n 21\n Luton  (peak only) Kentish Town  (off-peak)\n all stations\n via  Elephant & Castle Orpington  (via Catford)\n all stations\n 8-car\n All day [f] 22\n 23\n Welwyn Garden City  (peak only) London Blackfriars  (off-peak)\n stopping\n via  Elephant & Castle Sevenoaks  (via Catford and Otford)\n all stations\n 8-car\n All day [g] 24\n Rolling stock edit The new class 700 trains replaced all of the existing fleet in 2018 Interior of the new Thameslink Class 700 trains 86 Class 319s worked the Thameslink route from 1987 to 2018 Main articles:  Thameslink and Great Northern \u00a7\u00a0Thameslink , and  British Rail Class 700 Rolling stock used on Thameslink included the 86  Class 319  trains built between 1987\u20131988 and 1990. These are  electrically powered  dual-voltage four-car units rated to carry 289, 308 or 319 passengers. They use  25 kV AC  overhead power north of Farringdon and 750 V DC  third rail  to the south. Four Class 319 trains had been transferred from  Southern  in December 2008 and the last four followed in March 2009, from which point they were all on Thameslink. The last was withdrawn in August 2017. [16] First Capital Connect acquired 23 four-coach  Class 377  sets during 2009 on sublease from  Southern , for the Thameslink route for additional capacity and to allow some of the Class 319 trains to be released for the  Catford Loop  service to Sevenoaks, now jointly operated with  Southeastern  under  Key Output 0  of the Thameslink Programme. [17] Class 317  units built in the early 1980s were still in use when services into Moorgate ceased in March 2009: the last timetabled service ran from Farringdon to Bedford on 9 October 2009.\n New energy-efficient Class 700 trains provided an additional 14,500 seats clarification needed  and will be delivered from 2015 to 2018. [18] Siemens Mobility  was named preferred bidder on 16 June 2011, with the  Desiro City  train family. [19]  The contract was signed in June 2013 [20]  for 1140 carriages, with 55 twelve-car and 60 eight-car trains.  The depots are at  Hornsey  and  Three Bridges [19]  The Three Bridges depot opened in October 2015 and the first trains entered service in spring 2016.\n Due to delays in the new  Class 700  fleet, the DfT and Southern ordered 116 electric dual-voltage 110-mile-per-hour (180\u00a0km/h) carriages (29 trains) with the option for another 140 carriages (35 trains). [21] [22]  The tender for the new  Class 387  trains was won by Bombardier and the first set entered service in December 2014, with all in service by May 2015. These trains will move to  Great Northern  once the Class 700 is fully delivered. [23]  All rolling stock used on Thameslink is  electrically powered  dual-voltage units using  25 kV AC  overhead power north of Farringdon and 750 V DC  third rail  to the south.

On 29 March 2012, the  Department for Transport  announced  Abellio FirstGroup Govia MTR Corporation  and  Stagecoach Group  had pre-qualified to bid for the franchise. [24] Due to problems with the  InterCity West Coast  tendering process, the process was delayed, with the new franchise delayed until September 2014. The new franchise includes the  South Central  franchise currently operated by Southern and certain routes from the  Integrated Kent Franchise  currently operated by  Southeastern [25] On 23 May 2014, it was announced that the franchise has been awarded to  Govia Thameslink Railway [26]  The new Thameslink Southern & Great Northern franchise [10]  will include both the Thameslink Great Northern and South Central franchises.\n Govia Thameslink Railway began operations on 14 September 2014, with the former  First Capital Connect  routes Thameslink and  Great Northern Thameslink 2 edit \u2018Railfuture\u2019, an organisation campaigning for better rail services for passengers and freight, has proposed an additional north-south route, connecting the  Brighton Main Line  to routes north of London, via  East Croydon Lewisham Canary Wharf , and  Stratford [27] See also edit Crossrail  \u2013 an East-West route through London under construction West London Line  \u2013 the North West-South route across London R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional  \u2013 the similar cross city rail network in  Paris Cross-City Line  \u2013 a similar North-South route across  Birmingham Rail transport in Great Britain Notes edit a b Hourly on Sundays.

The station is in the  London Borough of Islington , just outside the boundary of the  City of London . It was opened in 1863 as the terminus of the  Metropolitan Railway , which was the world's first underground railway.\n Today the Underground station is served by the  Circle Hammersmith & City , and  Metropolitan lines  between  King's Cross St Pancras  and  Barbican . The National Rail station is one of the less important main line central London stations, being a stop on the  Thameslink route  between  St Pancras  and  City Thameslink , but that is expected to change when it becomes a major interchange station between the two largest transport infrastructure programmes currently under construction in the city:  Crossrail  and the  Thameslink Programme , both scheduled for completion in 2018\u20132019.\n Contents 1 History 2 Current developments 2.1 Thameslink upgrade 2.2 Crossrail project 2.3 Four Lines Modernisation (4LM) 3 Dual traction current supply 4 Accidents and incidents 5 Services 5.1 London Underground 5.1.1 Circle line 5.1.2 Hammersmith & City line 5.1.3 Metropolitan line 5.2 National Rail 6 Connections 7 References 8 External links History edit The station was opened on 10 January 1863 as the terminus of the original  Metropolitan Railway , the world's first underground  metro  line. The station, initially named  Farringdon Street , was originally a short distance from the present station building. The line ran from the  Farringdon  area to  Paddington , a distance of 4\u00a0mi (6\u00a0km). The station was relocated on 23 December 1865 when the Metropolitan Railway opened an extension to  Moorgate . It was renamed  Farringdon & High Holborn  on 26 January 1922 when the new building by the architect  Charles Walter Clark [6]  facing Cowcross Street was opened, and its present name was adopted on 21 April 1936. [7]  It was built in conjunction with a freight station to take  livestock  to a slaughterhouse to its south-east to supply  Smithfield Market ; remains of cattle ramps front the street West Smithfield. Smithfield was redesignated as a wholesale 'deadmeat' market in the 19th century and the Freight station was last used in the 1920s.\n The Metropolitan Railway's second Farringdon station, 1866. The station frontage carrying the name Farringdon & High Holborn, 1989. The lines from Farringdon to  King's Cross  run alongside the  Fleet ditch culverted  since 1734. [8]  The station building is unusually well-preserved early 20th-century London Underground architecture. It retains indications of the Metropolitan Railway's main-line style operation such as a sign for a Parcel Office on the outer wall and some original signage (with the 1922\u20131936 name on the fa\u00e7ade.\n After the bay platforms at  Blackfriars  closed on 21 March 2009,  Southeastern  services that previously terminated at Blackfriars were extended to  Kentish Town St. Albans Luton  or  Bedford , calling at this station. [9] Thameslink  trains to Moorgate ceased at the same time.\n Current developments edit There are three major rail development projects in progress that involve Farringdon.  Crossrail  is a new east-west railway scheduled to open in 2018, but now delayed until autumn 2019; the  Thameslink Programme  is a major upgrade to the existing north-south Thameslink route, enabling longer and more frequent trains, completed in 2018 and the Four Lines Modernisation which involves the wholesale resignalling of the London Underground's Sub-surface lines bringing a major boost in capacity to Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan line services calling at Farringdon once the project is completed by 2023. [10] Once all projects have been completed by 2023, Farringdon will be one of the country's busiest stations with approximately 200 tph, an average of one departure every 20 seconds. [11]  It will be the only station where passengers can change between Crossrail and Thameslink. A new building, housing a dedicated ticket hall, has been constructed to serve these extra passengers. The new building is to the immediate south of the original station, which itself has been upgraded as part of the programme.\n An additional entrance has also been built at the north end of the original station, onto  Turnmill Street Thameslink upgrade edit A  Class 319  heads south from Farringdon. On the left is the blocked-off  City Widened Line  branch to  Moorgate , closed as part of the  Thameslink Programme Farringdon Station has been rebuilt [12]  to accommodate longer Thameslink trains and to make other improvements to the station. [13]  The existing station building has been refurbished with a new roof canopy covering the north end of all four platforms and a new entrance and concourse facing Turnmill Street. An additional ticket hall has been built on the south side of  Cowcross Street  providing access to the Thameslink platforms, which have been extended southwards underneath this building, allowing the station to handle 240\u00a0m (12-carriage) trains. Platforms have been widened to accommodate increased passenger numbers. This process required the bridge that formed Cowcross Street to be demolished and rebuilt. [14]  Cowcross Street is now pedestrianised. [15]  Lifts have been provided throughout.\n The existing listed ticket hall and concourse have been remodelled, for use by London Underground and Thameslink passengers. [16]  Interchange within the station has been improved by removing the interchange bridge and installing new stairs and lifts with access to all four platforms, allowing passengers with impaired mobility to use the station. [17] It was necessary to build the Thameslink platform extensions to the south, since there is a sharp gradient to the immediate north of the station. This resulted in the two-station branch to  Moorgate  being permanently closed. [18]  The platform extensions cross the former Moorgate line and reach within a few metres of the entrance of the  Snow Hill Tunnel [19]  The alternative of realigning both the Thameslink and Circle/Hammersmith & City/Metropolitan lines was impractical as the latter crosses over the former on a bridge almost immediately to the north of the station. [19] Crossrail project edit The Farringdon  Crossrail  station is being built between Farringdon and  Barbican  Underground stations and it will have interchanges with both of them. [20]  Access at the Farringdon end will be via the new Thameslink ticket hall. Work was anticipated to be completed in 2018, but the scheduled opening date was postponed and is now planned for Autumn 2019. [21] [22]  Crossrail will link Farringdon to  Canary Wharf Abbey Wood Stratford , and  Shenfield  in the east with  Paddington Heathrow  and  Reading  in the west . The station will also be a hub for cross-London travel, being the only station to be on both the north-south Thameslink service and the east-west Crossrail service. [23] Four Lines Modernisation (4LM) edit The Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines otherwise known as the Sub-Surface lines make up over 40% of the London Underground network moving over 1.3 million passengers everyday stretching from busy commuter hubs to rural backwaters. They also cover some of the oldest infrastructure on the Underground network. For example, Edgware Road signal cabin situated on the Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines between Baker Street and Paddington opened in 1926 and is still in operation today requiring over 3600 manually operated lever movements a day. [24] [25]  This ageing system uses fixed block signalling where the track is divided into segments to keep trains a safe distance from each other. At the moment trains run further apart than they need to and data isn't centrally monitored which means that this system requires regular maintenance and faults are more expensive, as well as taking longer to locate and fix any faulty equipment which in-turn reduces service reliability.\n Since the Sub-Surface lines are closely interlinked Transport For London announced in March 2015 that the Sub-surface lines would be subject to a wholesale re-signalling programme to be known collectively as the Four Lines Modernisation or 4LM for short. The upgrade will replace all the signalling equipment on all four lines which will be monitored from a new control centre currently under construction in Hammersmith replacing the numerous signal cabins and service control centres across the four lines. [24] The new signalling system uses the  Thales SelTrac  moving block system otherwise known as  Communications Based Train Control (CBTC)  which uses Wifi to constantly let controllers know where trains are and how fast they are going. Precise speeds will be set by computers so trains will be able to run at higher speeds and closer together with a maximum service frequency of 32 trains per hour (every 2 minutes) in central London by the time the upgrade is complete in 2023. As well as reducing journey times a 33% increase in capacity will be created on all four lines making the best use out of 192  S-Stock  trains which too have a universal design exclusively for the Sub-surface lines. [24] Timeline [10] From 2021: more frequent trains in Zone 1 (30 trains per hour) at the busiest times From 2022: more frequent services in central London (up to 32 tph at peak times) and increases on the rest of the Metropolitan, District, and Hammersmith and City lines both at peak and off-peak periods From 2023: a further increase in services on the Metropolitan line at peak times, and increases in off peak services across all four lines Dual traction current supply edit Warning to drivers heading south from Farringdon in August 2012 Farringdon station is notable because  Thameslink  trains switch between the 25\u00a0 kV AC  overhead supply used to the north of London and the 750\u00a0V  DC third rail  supply used to the south whilst standing at the platform. The trains that formerly ran to Moorgate used 25\u00a0kV AC throughout their journeys.  This project was installed by the  Network SouthEast  sector of  British Rail  in May 1988.\n A  Network SouthEast  livery  British Rail Class 319  in the station switching power supply. Until the start of the  Thameslink Programme  southbound trains that were unable to switch to DC were taken out of service at Farringdon and stabled at  Moorgate  to prevent them from blocking the core section of the Thameslink route. As this option is no longer possible the  catenary  has been extended to City Thameslink to enable these trains to continue to the southbound platform [26]  at City Thameslink using AC and then return northwards using the new crossover in  Snow Hill Tunnel [27]  The  pantograph  on southbound trains is normally lowered at Farringdon.\n Underground trains serving Farringdon use the four-rail 630\u00a0V DC system.\n A  Metropolitan line S Stock  train departing Platform 1 with an Eastbound service to  Aldgate Accidents and incidents edit On 5 January 1867, 16 people were injured at Farringdon Street station in a rear-end collision caused by a signaller's error. [28] On 5 January 1892, a defective axlebox resulted in the derailment of part of a train shortly after it had departed Farringdon Street. Five passengers were injured. [29] On 26 November 1907, a train in the process of departing Farringdon Street was rear-ended by a second train entering the station. [30] On 1 May 1939, a total of 31 people were injured when a Circle line train was involved in a minor collision with a railway engine. Seventeen passengers reported they had suffered shock and injury while a further nine subsequently complained that they had incurred minor injuries. Five crew members were also injured. [31] On 22 May 1954, three people in a lorry were killed when it fell from a bridge on to the tracks near Farringdon. A goods train collied with the lorry shortly after departing Farringdon. [32] [33] Services edit Farringdon is in the core of the  Thameslink network , and is served by  Thameslink . These  Class 377 Electrostar  units as well as  Class 319  used to operate over the  Bedford  to  Brighton  route, however they have been replaced with  Class 700's  which now solely operate all services. London Underground edit Underground trains at Farringdon Station The London Underground part of the station is served by the  Metropolitan Hammersmith & City  and  Circle  lines, between  King's Cross St Pancras  and  Barbican . All three lines share the same pair of tracks from  Baker Street  Junction to  Aldgate  Junction making this section of track one of the most intensely used on the London Underground network.\n Circle line edit The typical service in trains per hour (tph) is: [34] 6 tph Clockwise via Liverpool Street and Tower Hill 6 tph To Hammersmith via King's Cross St Pancras and Paddington Hammersmith & City line edit The typical service in trains per hour (tph) is: [34] 6 tph Eastbound to Barking 6 tph Westbound to Hammersmith via Paddington Metropolitan line edit The Metropolitan line is the only line to operate express services, though currently this is only during peak times (Westbound 06:30\u201309:30 / Eastbound 16:00\u201319:00). Fast services run non-stop between  Wembley Park Harrow-on-the-Hill  and  Moor Park . Semi-fast services run non-stop between Wembley Park and Harrow-on-the-Hill. [35] The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is: [36] 12 tph Eastbound to Aldgate 2 tph Westbound to Amersham (all stations) 2 tph Westbound to Chesham (all stations) 8 tph Westbound to Uxbridge (all stations) Off-peak services to/from Watford terminate at Baker Street\n The typical peak time service in trains per hour (tph) is: [36] 14 tph Eastbound to Aldgate 2 tph Westbound to Amersham (fast in the evening peak only) 2 tph Westbound to Chesham (fast in the evening peak only) 4 tph Westbound to Watford (semi-fast in the evening peak only) 6 tph Westbound to Uxbridge (all stations) Farringdon is in  Transport for London 's  Travelcard Zone 1 National Rail edit All National Rail services at Farringdon are served by Thameslink trains between  St Pancras International  and  City Thameslink  using part of the  City Widened Lines  and  Snow Hill Tunnel  respectively.\n The new Thameslink timetable through London Bridge was introduced in May 2018, the current off peak service is as follows:\n Southbound\n 4 tph to  Brighton  via  Gatwick Airport Thameslink 2 tph to  Horsham  via  Gatwick Airport Thameslink 2 tph to  Gatwick Airport  via  Redhill Thameslink 2 tph to  Rainham  via  Greenwich Charlton Abbey Wood Dartford Gravesend  and  Gillingham Thameslink 2 tph to  Orpington 4 tph to  Sutton , 2 tph via  Wimbledon  and 2 tph via  Mitcham Junction Northbound\n 4 tph to  Bedford  via  St Pancras International St Albans City Luton Airport  and  Luton Town . (operated by  Thameslink 2 tph to  Luton Town  via  St Pancras International St Albans City  and  Luton Airport 4 tph to  St Albans City  via  St Pancras International 2 tph to  Kentish Town  via  St Pancras International 2 tph to  Cambridge  via  St Pancras International Stevenage  and  Hitchin Thameslink 2 tph to  Peterborough  via  St Pancras International Stevenage  and  Hitchin Thameslink After midnight, on all days, a half-hourly service runs between Bedford and Three Bridges. [37] Prior to 2009, Thameslink services also ran to  Moorgate  via  Barbican  with trains diverging of the core route east of the platforms at Farringdon, this section of line was closed as part of the  Thameslink Programme  which involved the construction of a new ticket hall and the lengthening of platforms at Farringdon to enable platform extensions to accommodate longer 12 carriage trains which covered over the junction in the process.\n Farringdon is in  Transport for London 's  Travelcard Zone 1 Connections edit London Buses routes  63  and  172 , and night route  N63  serve the station.\n References edit \"Step free Tube Guide\" (PDF) Transport for London .

in the  London Borough of Camden . It is at the junction of Kentish Town Road ( A400 ) and Leighton Road. It is in  Travelcard Zone 2 The station is served by the  High Barnet  branch of the London Underground  Northern line , and by  Thameslink  trains on the National Rail  Midland Main Line . It is between  Camden Town  and  Tufnell Park  on the Northern line and between  West Hampstead  and  St Pancras International  stations on the main line.\n It is the only station on the High Barnet branch with a direct interchange with a National Rail line; furthermore an  Out of Station Interchange  (OSI) with  Kentish Town West  on the  North London Line  is not charged as two separate journeys in electronic journey charging.\n There are four National Rail surface platforms and two London Underground underground platforms. National Rail trains are operated by  Thameslink , with northbound trains running to  Luton  and southbound to  Sutton Orpington  and  Sevenoaks , via  London St. Pancras  and  Blackfriars East Midlands Trains  express services from  Nottingham Sheffield  and  Leicester  pass through but do not stop.\n Ticket barriers control access to both London Underground and National Rail platforms.\n Contents 1 History 2 Development 3 Connections 4 References 5 External links History edit The entrance on Kentish Town Road in 1955 The Victorian Super Outer Circle route, passing through Kentish Town station The first station was opened by the  Midland Railway  in 1868 on the extension to its new London terminal at  St Pancras . Prior to that, Midland Railway trains used the  London and North Western Railway  lines to  Euston  or the  Great Northern Railway  lines to  King's Cross . Until the St. Pancras extension was complete, and for some time afterwards, some trains exchanged the locomotive at Kentish Town for one fitted with  condensing apparatus  and continued to  Moorgate station , then named Moorgate Street station. For some years trains ran from Kentish Town to  Victoria station  on the  South Eastern and Chatham Railway The second largest  motive power depot  and repair facility on the Midland Rail was north of the station. [4]  In 1861 a  collision  occurred at a siding near the station in which 16 people were killed and 317 were injured.\n From May 1878 to September 1880 the MR  Super Outer Circle  service ran through the station, from St. Pancras to  Earl's Court  Underground station via  Cricklewood  and  South Acton [5] \nThe main line station was rebuilt in 1983, nothing of the original station building remains. The separate London Underground station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the  Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway  (CCE&HR), a precursor of the Northern line. [6]  The station was designed by  Leslie Green  with the ox-blood red  glazed terracotta  fa\u00e7ade and the semi-circular windows at first floor level common to most of the original stations on the CCE&HR and its two associated railways, the  Baker Street and Waterloo Railway  and  Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway  which opened the previous year. When Kentish Town station opened the next CCE&HR station south was  South Kentish Town  but that station closed in 1924 due to low usage. [7] Gospel Oak  station on the  North London Line  opened in 1860 as \"Kentish Town\" but was given its present name in 1867 when the North London Railway opened  Kentish Town West .\nIt was the junction of services to Barking until 1981 when services were diverted to terminate and start from Gospel Oak. The spur line to Junction Road Junction was then closed, the track was removed and the trackbed has been sold for industrial use.\n The station's northbound  Northern line  platform. National Rail  platforms at Kentish Town station. Development edit Trains from south of the  River Thames  on the extended Thameslink network may call at the station from 2018. [8] After the bay platforms at Blackfriars station closed in March 2009,  Southeastern  services which previously terminated at Blackfriars were extended to Kentish Town (off-peak), or St Albans, Luton or Bedford (peak hours). [9] A major upgrading of the whole Thameslink line infrastructure is underway, for expected completion by 2018. However, the four platforms at Kentish Town station are not being extended from eight to 12 carriages because of road bridges at each end which cannot be relocated, [10]  so only services that continue to be served by eight-car trains will be able to call there. The only other Thameslink stations north of the  River Thames  remaining with eight-car platform lengths will be  Hendon  and  Cricklewood , which are sited either side of a possible new Thameslink station at  Brent Cross Connections edit First Capital Connect  train with a southbound  Thameslink  service. London Buses  routes  134 214 393  and  C2  and night route  N20  serve the station.\n References edit \"Out of Station Interchanges\" (XLS) Transport for London . May 2011.

This was submitted to a committee in London to which the title \"Great Northern Railway Company\" was provisionally given. However, the scheme came to nothing. [2] 1840s edit After plans for the Great Northern Railway had been rejected by parliament a second time, a bill for the London and York Railway  was issued on 3 May 1844, and plans were deposited in that year's  parliamentary session  for the following lines:\n Main line  London  to  York Loop from  Peterborough  to  Bawtry  via  Boston  and  Lincoln Branch from Bawtry to  Sheffield Branch from  Doncaster  to  Wakefield Branch to  Bedford Branch from  Stamford  to  Spalding [3] [4] The line passed its second reading in the commons despite fierce opposition from the  London and Birmingham  and the newly formed  Midland Railway , who at that time had a monopoly of the London to  Leeds  and York traffic, and despite an adverse report from the  Board of Trade In the 1845 session, the sheer number of railway projects plus opposition from established companies and from rival projects meant that the London and York bill, although not defeated, failed by running out of time.\n The London and York bill finally received Royal assent on 26 June 1846 as The Great Northern Railway Act, 1846. [5]  The Act granted powers to construct the main line and loop lines. Also in the 1846 session, powers were granted to various allied companies to make lines from Boston to  Grimsby  and Stamford to Spalding\u00a0\u2013 which was never built\u00a0\u2013 and also the  Hitchin  to  Royston  section only of a proposed Oxford and Cambridge Railway.\n The Great Northern began construction first on the Peterborough to  Gainsborough  section of the loop line, as the ease of construction over the flat fens promised an earlier return on investment. Because a proposed branch from Bawtry to Sheffield had been rejected by parliament, it was thought better for the loop line to rejoin the towns line at  Rossington  instead, so no work was done on the loop north of Gainsborough. The GNR suffered a setback in 1848 when this deviation was rejected, but arrangements were soon made to use the  MS&LR 's authorized line from Sykes Junction (on the loop line north of Lincoln) to Retford and then via their own main line, and contracts for both of these lines were quickly let. [6] The first section of line was opened on 1 March 1848 and was the  Louth  to  Grimsby  section of the  East Lincolnshire Railway , which although nominally independent, was leased to the GNR from the start. The first section of GNR proper to be opened was the 3 miles from  Doncaster  to Askern Junction, where an end on connection was made with the  Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway  line from  Knottingley The East Lincolnshire line opened from Louth to Boston on 1 October 1848, and on 17 October, the loop line opened between Werrington Junction and  Lincoln , with GNR trains using the Midland line from Werrington Junction to Peterborough. The GNR and MS&LR lines allowing through running from Lincoln to Doncaster via  Retford  opened on 4 September 1849. [7] The immediate targets in the north were  Leeds  and  York . On 30 June 1847, the GNR obtained running powers over the LYR from Askern to Wakefield via Knottingley, and also from Knottingley to Methley on the Midland, and on 16 October the Midland agreed to allow the GNR to run from Methley to Leeds.\n On 23 February 1849, the  York and North Midland Railway  agreed in principle to give the GNR running powers from Burton Salmon to York, and also over a new line to be built from Knottingley to Burton Salmon. This new line was opened in June 1850, at which time the agreement was formalised and in return the GNR agreed not to proceed with its own main line from Askern to York via  Selby [8] First 20 miles from London edit During 1846 to 1849  George Turnbull  was the resident engineer under  William Cubitt  for the London District of the Great Northern Railway. Turnbull oversaw the construction of  King's Cross station  and the first 20 miles of line out of London, including bridges, multiple cuttings and (sequentially from London) the  Copenhagen , Tottenham (now called Wood Green), South Barnett (now  Barnet ), North Barnett (now Hadley Wood South & North) and South Mimms (now Potters Bar) tunnels. [9] In December 1848 Turnbull was busy with the plans for King's Cross station and passing the line through Gasworks tunnel under the  Regent's Canal . On 2 February 1849 the last capstone on Holloway Bridge was set in place. On 27 March the first brick for the South Mimms tunnel was laid by Edward Purser. The first brick of the East Barnet tunnel was laid on 23 April. There was much trouble with the cement in the Tottenham and South Mimms tunnels: Turnbull stopped the use of this cement\u00a0\u2014 blue lias was substituted (this was made by burning the blue clay from the tunnels and grinding it, effectively an early version of  Portland cement [10] [11] Another of the engineers working under Cubitt was  James Moore , who went on to design the first commercial steam railway in Australia for the  Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company [12] 1850s edit The former GNR works at  Boston, Lincolnshire On 7 August 1850, the main line opened from a temporary station at  Maiden Lane , London, to Peterborough. The remaining section between Peterborough and Retford opened in 1852, as did the new London terminus at  King's Cross Doncaster locomotive works  opened in 1853, replacing temporary facilities at Boston.\n On 1 August 1854, the  Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway  opened between Leeds and Bowling Junction near Bradford. Because it had running powers over this line (the right to operate locomotives and trains) and a section of the LYR, the GNR obtained access to Bradford and Halifax. [13]  In 1857, the West Yorkshire Railway opened their direct line from Wakefield to Leeds via Ardsley. The GNR had running powers over this line and immediately began using it instead of the Midland line via Methley. Also in 1857, the previously mentioned LB&HJR opened a direct line from Ardsley to Laisterdyke, near Bradford. In 1851, by agreement with the MS&LR, the GNR began a London to Manchester via Retford service, and from 1859 GNR trans also ran to Huddersfield via Penistone. [14] Thus by the end of the 1850s, the GNR had gained access to most of West Yorkshire, although without at this time owning any lines beyond Askern Junction, a few miles north of Doncaster. The profits gained from the coal traffic from this area to London prompted the  Great Eastern Railway  and  Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway  to promote a bill for a trunk line from Doncaster through Lincolnshire, but this was rejected by Parliament in both 1865 and 1871.\n Further south, a branch from Hitchin to Royston and on to Shepreth was opened in March 1850 and worked by the GNR. This line was meant to connect with a previously authorized GER line at Shepreth. The GER had not built this line but opposed GNR powers to extend from Shepreth to Cambridge themselves. An agreement was reached for the GER to build the Shepreth to Cambridge section and then work the whole  line from Hitchin to Cambridge  for 14 years, with the GER taking over the expensive guarantee that the GNR had given to the Hitchin & Royston company.\n The  Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway  opened from Colwick, near Nottingham, to Grantham in July 1850 (using a temporary station in Grantham pending completion of the town's line). In May 1852 the GNR agreed to work this line, but the agreement was opposed by the Midland, and it was not until 1861 that the GNR got formal possession. Midland obstruction of GNR through traffic in Nottingham led to the ANB&EJR seeking powers to build a parallel line from Colwick to its own station in Nottingham at London Road.\n East of Grantham, the Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway opened from near Grantham to Sleaford in June 1857 and on to Boston in April 1859. Independent companies also built branches from Essendine to Stamford and Bourne and from Welwyn to Hertford and to Dunstable via Luton, all of which were worked by the GNR.\n From 1858 the GNR line into London from Hitchin was also used by the Midland. This and the agreements with the MS&LR helped to undermine the \"Euston Square Confederacy\" established by the  London and North Western Railway [15] GNR agreements with the MS&LR also led to the GNR investing in lines between Manchester and Liverpool. The Midland also became involved, and an extensive joint line grew which became known as the  Cheshire Lines Committee [16] 1860s edit .mw-parser-output .RMbox{box-shadow:0 2px 2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.14),0

role in the establishment of an Anglo-Scottish East Coast route was confirmed by establishment of the East Coast Joint Stock in 1860, whereby a common pool of passenger vehicles was operated by the GNR, the  North Eastern  and the  North British [17]  The main express trains were the 10am departures from King's Cross and  Edinburgh , which began running in June 1862. By the 1870s they were known as the  Flying Scotsman The Welwyn & Hertford Railway opened in March 1858, and in 1860 it opened another line to Luton and Dunstable. In 1861, now called the Hertford, Luton & Dunstable, it was absorbed by the GNR. Also acquired in 1861 was the ANB&EJR line from Nottingham to Grantham.\n On 1 October 1863, the GNR began a shuttle service from King's Cross to Farringdon Street via the city widened lines, but through suburban services did not use this line until 1 March 1868, and then were extended to Moorgate Street on 1 June 1869.\n In 1864, the GNR acquired BS&MCR (Boston to Sleaford) and the Bourne and Essendine lines, leased the West Yorkshire (Wakefield to Leeds with branches to Batley and Ossett) and took a one third share in the Methley Joint (Castleford to Lofthouse & Outwood). In 1865 they acquired the Leeds, Bradford & Halifax and the previously mentioned West Yorkshire.\n In 1866, at the end of the 14-year agreement with the GER, the GNR resumed working the Hitchin and Shepreth line and began running through to Cambridge.\n On 1 August 1866, the GNR made an agreement with the Midland to jointly work the Eastern & Midland Railway, comprising a line from Bourne to King's Lynn via Spalding. The GNR gave the Midland running powers from Stamford to Bourne via Essendine in return for the Midland dropping a proposed line from Saxby to Bourne.\n Three new lines opened in 1867 were March to Spalding on 1 April, Honington to Lincoln on 15 April and Gainsborough to Doncaster on 15 July. These lines were partly tactical, with a view to blocking repeated GER and LYR proposals for a new north\u00a0\u2013 south line through the area. Also opened in 1867, on 22 August, was the Edgware & Highgate Railway from Seven Sisters Road to Edgware, which had been acquired by the GNR in June 1866.\n North of Doncaster, it opened the  West Riding and Grimsby Railway  in February 1866, a joint venture with the MS&LR, giving the GNR a new direct express line to Wakefield and the West Yorkshire Railway's onward lines to Leeds, Bradford and Halifax, which it had bought out the previous year.\n Seven Sisters Road station, a few miles north of King's Cross, had been opened on 1 July 1861. It was renamed Finsbury Park when a new public park of that name opened nearby in August 1868.\n 1870s edit The GNR was most profitable in 1873, running a more intensive service of express trains than either the LNWR or the MR. Hauled by  Patrick Stirling 's single-driving-wheel locomotives, its trains were some of the fastest in the world.\n However, in 1875, the increase in revenue was out-paced by investment, which included items such as block signalling systems and interlocking, and improvements to stations and goods sidings.\n A number of branch lines were opened in the 1870s, including Bourne to Sleaford in 1870, Wood Green to Enfield in 1871, Finchley to High Barnet in 1872, Highgate to Alexandra Palace and Wainfleet to Skegness in 1873, Ossett to Dewsbury in 1874, Bradford to Shipley and Sedgebrook to Barkston in 1875, Newark to Bottesford and the  Pudsey Greenside branch  in 1878, and finally the Queensbury to Ovenden line in 1879, which completed a new route from Bradford to Halifax.\n The increasing London suburban traffic caused problems in the King's Cross area, as there were only 2 tracks through the various tunnels, and also goods trains entering King's Cross goods yard had to cross the down line on the level. Pending doubling of the tunnels, a connection was made between Finsbury Park and the  North London Railway  at Canonbury, and some suburban traffic then ran into  Broad Street . The Broad Street trains were operated by the NLR as the LNWR, part owners of Broad Street, blocked GNR attempts to gain access.\n Also in the 1870s, the GNR was participating in various extensions to the CLC network in Lancashire, thereby risking overextending itself on marginally profitable lines well outside its natural territory.\n Much more promising was the development of the  Derbyshire and Staffordshire extension , which promised good returns by tapping the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire coalfields. The Erewash valley line was in use for coal trains by 1875, and complete opening from Nottingham to Egginton Junction via Gedling, Daybrook and Derby Friargate came in April 1878. But in order to overcome local opposition, the GNR had had to agree to LNWR running powers from Burton-on-Trent, which somewhat diminished the value of the investment. The LNWR had even better access from December 1879 with the opening of the GN&LNWR joint line from Melton Mowbray to Market Harborough, the northern section having already opened on 30 June.\n 1880s edit The early 1880s began badly for the GNR for a number of reasons: Coal strikes and poor harvests reduced income from goods traffic. Floods forced the complete closure of the Spalding to Bourne line from 9 October 1880 until 1 February 1881, this was a Midland & Eastern line worked by the GNR, and the GNR found themselves paying the lease on a line they could derive no revenue from; and worst of all, Sutton Bridge Docks opened on 14 May 1881, into which the GNR had invested \u00a355,000, but within a few days the docks began to subside due to being built on unstable ground. The engineers could find no remedy and the investment was written off.\n Better news was the excellent returns from the coal traffic over the Derbyshire extension line. To consolidate this, in the 1880 session the GNR introduced a bill for a branch from Bulwell to Newstead, and this opened for coal traffic in July 1881 and for passengers on 2 October 1882. In 1881 the GNR bought out the  Stafford & Uttoxeter Railway , reached from the Derbyshire extension by running powers over the North Staffordshire Railway.\n Meanwhile, in Lincolnshire, the new Spalding to Lincoln direct line opened from Spalding via Sleaford to Ruskington on 6 March 1882 and on the Lincoln on 1 August, on which date the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway came into being comprising in addition to the new Spalding\u00a0\u2013 Lincoln line, the former GNR March to Spalding and Lincoln to Doncaster lines and the former GER Huntingdon to March line plus the Ramsey branch from Somersham. To the GER this was the line to the Yorkshire coal fields they had long been seeking, to the GNR it provided a new alternative line for freight from Huntingdon to Doncaster to relieve pressure on the main line. In the first five months of the joint line, the GNR lost \u00a350,000 due to diverted traffic, but according to Lord Colville, chairman of the GNR, it was better to have half the receipts of a joint line than to have to compete with a new entirely foreign through line.\n The Leicester branch from the GN&LNWR joint line at Marefield Junction opened on 1 January 1883, and in West Yorkshire, Thornton to Denholme opened on 1 January 1884 and on to Keighley on 1 November.\n In 1888, the Midland & Eastern Railway obtained powers to build a new connection to the Midland from Bourne to Saxby, citing the difficulty of operating through traffic from Bourne to Stamford via Essendine. The act also gave the Midland powers to absorb the Bourne and Lynn and the Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge. This posed a menace to GNR interests, and as a result the GNR made an agreement with the Midland to jointly acquire the western section of the Eastern & Midland.\n 1890s edit Widening of the London end of the main line was completed in the 1890s.\n 1900s edit Work started in 1905 to extend the Enfield Branch Railway in order to relieve congestion on the East Coast Main Line.  Cuffley  was reached on 4 April 1910, but construction of two major viaducts and the 2,684 yards or 2,454 metres  Ponsbourne Tunnel  combined with wartime shortages of men and materials, delayed the opening of the route to  Stevenage  until 4 March 1918 for goods services. The line finally opened to passengers on 2 June 1924 as the  Hertford Loop Line [18] 1910s edit GNR designed stock built under the LNER in 1924 During  World War I , various economies were made beginning on 22 February 1915 with a general reduction of train services. Trains tended to become fewer, but longer. An agreement was also reached with the GCR and GER regarding the common use of wagons.\nFurther economies were made in 1916 when the Nottingham to Daybrook and Peterborough to Leicester services were withdrawn, never to be reinstated.\n 1920s edit Under the 1923 Grouping, the Great Northern became part of the  London and North Eastern Railway St Albans branch edit Main article:  Hatfield and St Albans Railway In 1865 a branch line opened from  Hatfield  to  St Albans Abbey  via  St Albans (London Road) . It closed to passengers in 1951 [19]  and to freight in 1969. [20]  The track was subsequently removed and the route turned into a 6.5-mile (10.5\u00a0km) long cycle path called the  Alban Way . Public transport links between Hatfield and St Albans are now provided by local bus operators such as  Arriva Shires & Essex  and  Uno Stations on the branch were:\n St Albans Abbey St Albans (London Road)  (1865\u20131964) Salvation Army Halt  (1897\u20131951) Hill End  (1899\u20131964) Smallford  (1866\u20131969) Nast Hyde Halt  (1910\u20131951) Lemsford Road Halt  (1942\u20131951) Hatfield Remnants of many of the closed stations still exist alongside the Alban Way.\n Leicester branch edit Great Northern Railway\u00a0\u2013 Western Extensions Detail Legend Stafford (LNWR) Stafford Common Salt Ingestre Chartley Grindley Bromshall (1848\u20131866) Uttoxeter (NSR) Marchington (NSR) Sudbury (NSR) Tutbury (NSR) Burton-on-Trent (NSR) Rolleston-on-Dove (NSR) Egginton Junction Etwall Mickleover Derby Friargate Breadsall Shirebrook West Hallam Pleasley Heanor Skegby Marlpool Sutton-in-Ashfield Pinxton Newstead Ilkeston Pye Hill & Somercotes Awsworth Codnor Park & Selston Eastwood & Langley Mill Linby Newthorpe Hucknall Kimberley Butler's Hill Basford & Bulwell Bestwood Colliery Bulwell Common (GCR) Bulwell Forest Daybrook New Basford (GCR) Sherwood Carrington (GCR) St Ann's Well Nottingham Victoria (GCR) Thorney Wood Gedling Nottingham London Road High Level Netherfield Radcliffe-on-Trent Leicester Belgrave Road Bingham Humberstone Aslockton Thurnby & Scraptoft Elton Ingarsby Newark Lowesby Cotham Melton Mowbray Bottesford Sedgebrook Peterborough Grantham GN&LNWR Joint The Leicester branch was a Great Northern branch line from the  Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway  at Marefield Junction. This had the following stations:\n Lowesby Ingarsby Thurnby & Scraptoft Humberstone Leicester Belgrave Rd Between Humberstone and Belgrave Road the railway crossed the  Midland Main Line , but there was no interchange.  Services from Leicester commenced in 1882 and ran to  Peterborough  and  Newark  until 1916 and  Grantham  until 1953. Summer specials to  Skegness  continued until 1962.\n Joint lines edit The Great Northern was involved in a number of joint railways.\n Cheshire Lines Committee edit Main article:  Cheshire Lines Committee The  Cheshire Lines Committee  (CLC) was formed in 1862 by the Great Northern and   Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire . The  Midland Railway  became a partner in 1865. The system was the second largest in the country, comprising 143 miles of route, running from  Manchester  and  Stockport  to  Liverpool Chester  and  Southport Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway edit Main article:  Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway The  Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway  was a line running from March to  Doncaster  and also from March to  Huntingdon . The line gave the  Great Eastern Railway  much needed access to the  Yorkshire  coal fields.\n Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway edit Main article:  Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway The  Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway  was a system in east  Leicestershire  designed to give the GNR access to  Leicester  and the  London and North Western Railway  access to  Nottingham  and to allow the exploitation of ironstone deposits in the  Melton Mowbray  area.\n Halifax and Ovenden Junction Railway edit Main article:  Queensbury lines A 1913  Railway Clearing House  Junction Diagram showing (lower left) the Halifax & Ovenden Joint Railway (blue & orange) and the Halifax High Level Railway (red).

[23] Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway edit Main article:  Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway The  Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway  comprised a main line ran from  Peterborough  to  Great Yarmouth  via South Lynn (with running powers to  King's Lynn ) and  Melton Constable . Branches ran from  Sutton Bridge  to the  Midland Railway  near Little Bytham, from Melton Constable to  Cromer , and from Melton Constable to  Norwich In addition, the  Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway  was a joint line owned by the M&GNR and the  Great Eastern Railway . This ran between  Cromer  and  North Walsham  and between  Great Yarmouth  and  Lowestoft Methley Joint edit GNR, LYR and NER. Lofthouse & Outwood to Castleford.\n South Yorkshire Joint Railway edit GNR, GCR, LYR, MR and NER. Doncaster through the Coalfields serving collieries in the area to Worksop\n West Riding and Grimsby Joint Railway edit Main article:  West Riding and Grimsby Railway This line was constructed from  Wakefield  to  Doncaster  and opened in 1866. It gave the Great Northern the opportunity to run services from King's Cross to Leeds wholly on their own lines. There was also a branch from  Adwick  (north of Doncaster) to  Hatfield and Stainforth , thereby allowing the GNR to access the  South Humberside  area, hence the name. [24] Train services edit The GNR operated services from  London King's Cross  to  York  together with many secondary lines and branches. The Great Northern was a partner (with the  North Eastern Railway  and the  North British Railway ) in the  East Coast Joint Stock  operation from 1860.\n Accidents edit Main article:  Abbots Ripton rail accident  On 21 January 1876, an express passenger train ran into the rear of a freight train at  Abbots Ripton Huntingdonshire  when signals became frozen in the \"clear\" position during a blizzard. Thirteen people were killed and 59 were injured. On 14 April 1876, an express train ran into the rear of a mail train at  Corby Northamptonshire  when signals froze in the \"clear\" position during a blizzard. [25] On 23 December 1876, an express train overran signals and collided with a number of wagons at Arlesley Sidings,  Bedfordshire . Six people were killed. [25] On 7 March 1896, a passenger train derailed at  Little Bytham Northamptonshire  when a speed restriction was removed prematurely after track renewal. Two people were killed. [26] Main article:  Grantham rail accident  On 19 September 1906, a sleeping car train derailed at  Grantham Lincolnshire  when it  passed signals at danger  and ran through the station at excessive speed. Fourteen people were killed and seventeen were injured.

It is in the  London station group , one of the  busiest stations in the United Kingdom  and the southern terminus of the  East Coast Main Line  to  North East England  and  Scotland . Adjacent to King's Cross station is  St Pancras International , the London terminus for  Eurostar  services to continental Europe. Beneath both main line stations is  King's Cross St. Pancras tube station  on the  London Underground ; combined they form one of the country's largest transport hubs.\n The station was opened in  Kings Cross  in 1852 by the  Great Northern Railway  on the northern edge of  Central London  to accommodate the East Coast Main Line. It quickly grew to cater for suburban lines and was expanded several times in the 19th century. It came under the ownership of the  London and North Eastern Railway  as part of the  Big Four  grouping in 1923, who introduced famous services such as the  Flying Scotsman  and locomotives such as  Mallard . The station complex was redeveloped in the 1970s, simplifying the layout and providing electric suburban services, and it became a major terminus for the high-speed  InterCity 125 . As of 2018 [update] , long-distance trains from King's Cross are run by  London North Eastern Railway   to  Edinburgh Waverley  and  Glasgow Central  via  York  and  Newcastle ; other long-distance operators include  Hull Trains  and  Grand Central . In addition,  Great Northern  runs suburban commuter trains in and around north London.\n In the late 20th century, the area around the station became known for its seedy and downmarket character, and was used as a backdrop for several films as a result. A major redevelopment was undertaken in the 21st century, including restoration of the original roof, and the station became well known for its association with the  Harry Potter  books and films, particularly the fictional  Platform 9\u00be Contents 1 Location and name 2 History 2.1 Early history 2.2 Great Northern Railway (1850\u20131923) 2.3 London and North Eastern Railway (1923\u20131948) 2.4 British Rail (1948\u20131996) 2.5 Privatisation (1996\u2013present) 2.6 Restoration 2.7 Future Remodelling 2.8 Accidents and incidents 3 Other stations 3.1 King's Cross York Road 3.2 Great Northern Cemetery Station 4 Services 4.1 Train services 4.1.1 London North Eastern Railway 4.1.2 Thameslink and Great Northern 4.1.3 Hull Trains 4.1.4 Grand Central 4.2 Routes 5 Tube station 6 Cultural references 6.1 In fiction 6.2 In film 6.3 Monopoly 7 References 8 External links 8.1 Video links Location and name edit The station stands on the  London Inner Ring Road  at the eastern end of  Euston Road , next to the junction with  Pentonville Road Gray's Inn Road  and  York Way , in what is now the  London Borough of Camden . To the west, at the other side of Pancras Road, is  St Pancras railway station [3]  Several London bus routes, including  10 30 59 73 91 205 , 390,  476  pass in front of or to the side of the station. [4] King's Cross is spelled both with and without an  apostrophe King's Cross  is used in signage at the  Network Rail  and  London Underground  stations, on the  Tube map  and on the official Network Rail webpage. [5]  It rarely featured on early Underground maps, but has been consistently used on them since 1951. [6] Kings X Kings +  and  London KX  are abbreviations used in space-limited contexts. The National Rail  station code  is  KGX [7] History edit Early history edit The area of  King's Cross  was previously a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the  River Fleet , originally known as Broad Ford, later Bradford Bridge. The river flowed along what is now the west side of Pancras Road until it was rerouted underground in 1825. [8]  The name \"Battle Bridge\" is linked to tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the  Celtic British Iceni  tribe led by  Boudica . According to folklore, King's Cross is the site of Boudica's final battle and some sources say she is buried under one of the platforms. [9]  Platforms 9 and 10 have been suggested as possible sites. [9] [10]  Boudica's ghost is also reported to haunt passages under the station, around platforms 8\u201310. [11] Great Northern Railway (1850\u20131923) edit King's Cross in 1852 King's Cross station was built in 1851\u201352 as the London terminus of the  Great Northern Railway  (GNR), and was the fifth London terminal to be constructed. [12]  It replaced a temporary station next to Maiden Lane (now  York Way ) that had been quickly constructed with the line's arrival in London in 1850. [13] The station took its name from the  King's Cross building , a monument to  King George IV  that stood in the area and was demolished in 1845. [14]  Construction was on the site of a  smallpox  hospital and it replaced a temporary terminus at  Maiden Lane  that had opened on 7 August 1850. [15] Plans for the station were made in December 1848 under the direction of  George Turnbull , resident engineer for constructing the first 20 miles (32\u00a0km) of the Great Northern Railway out of London. [16] [17]  The station's detailed design was by  Lewis Cubitt , the brother of  Thomas Cubitt  (the architect of  Bloomsbury Belgravia  and  Osborne House ), and Sir  William Cubitt  (who was chief engineer of  The Crystal Palace  built in 1851, and consulting engineer to the  Great Northern  and  South Eastern  Railways). The design comprised two great arched  train sheds , with a brick structure at the south end designed to reflect the arches behind. [18]  Its main feature was a 112-foot (34\u00a0m) high clock tower that held treble, tenor and bass bells, the latter weighing 1 ton 9 cwt (1.47 tonnes). [19]  In size, it was inspired by the 200 yards (180\u00a0m) long  Moscow Riding Academy  of 1825, [20]  leading to its built length of 268 yards (245\u00a0m). [12] [a] Plan of King's Cross in 1888. Originally there was only one arrival and one departure platform. The station, the biggest in England, opened on 14 October 1852. [12]  Originally it had one arrival and one departure platform (today's platforms 1 and 8), and the space between was used for carriage sidings. [13]  The platforms have been reconfigured several times. They have been numbered 1 to 8 since 1972. [21] \nSuburban traffic quickly grew with the opening of stations at  Hornsey  in 1850,  Holloway Road  in 1856,  Wood Green  in 1859 and Seven Sisters Road (now  Finsbury Park ) in 1861.  Midland Railway  services to  Leicester  via  Hitchin  and  Bedford  began running from King's Cross on 1 February 1858. [22]  More platforms were added in 1862; No.\u00a02 was full-length but No.\u00a03 was stepped into the northern end of the station. [23]  In 1866, a connection was made via the  Metropolitan Railway  to the  London, Chatham and Dover Railway  at  Farringdon , with goods and passenger services to South London via  Herne Hill [24]  A separate suburban station to the west of the main building, housing platforms 9\u201311 as of 1972 [update]  and known initially as \"Kings Cross Main Line (Local) Station\", opened in August 1875. It was followed by a connection to the  Metropolitan line  on 1 February 1878. [25]  Two platforms (now 5 and 6) were opened on 18 December 1893 to cater for increased traffic demands. An iron footbridge was built halfway down the train shed to connect all the platforms. [26]  By 1880, half the traffic at King's Cross was suburban. [27] A significant bottleneck in the early years of operations was at Gas Works tunnel underneath the  Regent's Canal  immediately to the north of the station, which was built with a single up and down track. Commercial traffic was further impeded by having to cross over on-level running lines to reach the goods yard. [24]  Grade separation of goods traffic was achieved by constructing the skew bridge that opened in August 1877 and the second and third Gas Works tunnels opened in 1878 and 1892 respectively. [28] On 15 September 1881, a light engine and a coal train collided near the mouth of the  Copenhagen Tunnel  north of the station because of a signalman's error. One person was killed and another was severely injured. [29]  Bad weather contributed to flooding in the tunnels. One such incident in July 1901 suspended all traffic from the station for more than four hours, which happened at no other London terminus. [30] King's Cross sustained no damage during  World War I  even though large amounts of high explosives were carried to the station in passenger trains during this time. Where possible, trains were parked in tunnels in the event of enemy aircraft overhead. [31] London and North Eastern Railway (1923\u20131948) edit Steam trains at King's Cross in 1928 Kings Cross came into the ownership of the  London and North Eastern Railway  (LNER) following the  Railways Act 1921 . The LNER made improvements to various amenities, including toilets and dressing rooms underneath what is now platform 8. [32]  The lines through the Gas Works tunnels were remodelled between 1922 and 1924 and improved signalling made it easier to manage the increasing number of local trains. [33] A number of famous trains have been associated with King's Cross, such as the  Flying Scotsman  service to Edinburgh. [34]  The  Gresley A3  and later streamlined  A4 Pacific  steam locomotives handled express services from the 1930s until 1966. [35]  The most famous of these was  Mallard , which holds the world speed record for steam locomotives at 126 miles per hour (203\u00a0km/h), set in 1938. [36] King's Cross handled large numbers of troops alongside civilian traffic during  World War II . Engine shortages meant that up to 2,000 people had to be accommodated on each train. In the early hours of Sunday 11 May 1941, two 1,000 pounds (450\u00a0kg) bombs fell on the west side of the station, destroying the general offices, booking hall and a bar, and blowing out a large section of roof. Twelve people were killed; the death total would have been higher if the blast had occurred during a busy period. [37] On 4 February 1945, a passenger train to Leeds and Bradford stalled in Gasworks Tunnel, ran back and was  derailed in the station . Two people were killed and 25 were injured. Services were not fully restored until 23 February. [38] [39] British Rail (1948\u20131996) edit Train headed by a  Class 55  'Deltic' locomotive at King's Cross platform 5 in 1978, these were the principal express locomotives on the East Coast Main Line in the 1960s and 70s. Following  nationalisation  on 1 January 1948, King's Cross came under the management of  British Railways Eastern Region . Diesel services were introduced during the 1950s when steam was being phased out. All main line services were converted to diesel by June 1963. [37]  Platform numbers were reorganised in 1972, to run consecutively from 1 (east) to 14 (west). The track layout was simplified in the 1970s by reusing an old flyover for freight near the Copenhagen Tunnels at Holloway, and reducing the number of running lanes through the Gas Works tunnels from six to four. At the same time, electrification started with the installation of a 25\u00a0kV overhead line to cater for suburban services as part of the  Great Northern Suburban Electrification  project. [40]  The works were completed on 3 April 1977, and electric services began running from King's Cross to  Hertford Welwyn Garden City  and  Royston [41] ; one of the few service improvements made in the area under the  late-1970s Labour government [42] The construction of the  Victoria line  and its interchange at King's Cross was seen by British Rail as an opportunity to modernise the station. [43]  A single-storey extension containing the main passenger concourse and ticket office, designed in-house, was built at the front of the station in 1972. Although intended to be temporary, it was still standing 40\u00a0years later obscuring the  Grade I-listed  fa\u00e7ade of the original station. [44]  Before the extension was built, the fa\u00e7ade was hidden behind a small terrace of shops. The extension was demolished in late 2012, [45]  revealing the  Lewis Cubitt  architecture. In its place, the 75,000-square-foot (7,000\u00a0m 2 ) King's Cross Square was created, which was opened to the public on 26 September 2013. [46] On 10 September 1973, a  Provisional IRA  bomb exploded in the booking hall at 12.24\u00a0p.m., causing extensive damage and injuring six people, some seriously. The 3\u00a0lb (1.4\u00a0kg) device was thrown without warning by a youth who escaped into the crowd and was not caught. [47] King's Cross was a London terminus for  InterCity 125  high speed services, along with  Paddington . By 1982, almost all long-distance trains leaving King's Cross were 125s. The service proved to be popular, and the station saw regular queues across the concourse to board departing trains. [48] The  King's Cross fire  in 1987 started in the machine room for a wooden escalator between the main line station and the  London Underground station 's  Piccadilly line  platforms. The escalator burnt up and much of the tube station caught fire, killing 31 people, with smoke spreading to the main line station. [49] In 1987, British Rail proposed building a new station with four platforms for international trains through the  Channel Tunnel , and four for  Thameslink  trains under King's Cross. After six years of design work, the plans were abandoned, and the international terminal was constructed at St. Pancras. [27] British Rail completed electrification of the East Coast Main Line to Leeds and Edinburgh between 1985 and 1991, and the current  InterCity 225  rolling stock was introduced to work express services. These began service between King's Cross and Leeds on 2 October 1989, and to Edinburgh on 8 July 1991. [50] [51] Privatisation (1996\u2013present) edit The former concourse seen in 2008 Before privatisation, the King's Cross area had a reputation for run-down buildings and prostitution in front of the main entrance. A major clean-up took place during the 1990s and the station's atmosphere was much improved by the end of the decade. [27] Following the  privatisation of British Rail  in 1996, express services into the station were taken over by the  Great North Eastern Railway  (GNER). The company refurbished the  British Rail Mark 4  \"Mallard\" rolling stock used for long-distance services from King's Cross and the inauguration of the new-look trains took place in the presence of  the Queen  and  the Duke of Edinburgh  in 2003. [52] GNER successfully re-bid for the franchise in 2005 but surrendered it the following year. [53] National Express East Coast  took over the franchise in late 2007 after an interim period when trains ran under a management contract. [54]  In 2009, it was announced that National Express was no longer willing to finance the East Coast subsidiary and the franchise was taken back into public ownership and handed over to  East Coast  in November. [55]  In March 2015 the franchise was re-privatised and taken over by  Virgin Trains East Coast [56]  In November 2017, Transport Secretary  Chris Grayling  announced the early termination of the East Coast franchise in 2020, three years ahead of schedule, following losses on the route by the operator and the current provider of ECML services is  London North Eastern Railway [57] [58] Restoration edit King's Cross following refurbishment in 2012. The steel structure of the roof, engineered by  Arup , has been described as being \"like some kind of reverse waterfall, a white steel grid that swoops up from the ground and cascades over your head\". [59] The \u00a3500\u00a0million restoration plan announced by  Network Rail  in 2005 was approved by  Camden London Borough Council  in 2007. [60]  It involved restoring and reglazing the original arched train shed roof and removing the 1972 extension at the front of the station and replacing it with an open-air plaza. [59] [61] The new semi-circular departures concourse opened to the public in March 2012. [62] [63]  Situated to the west of the station behind the Great Northern Hotel, it was designed by  John McAslan  and built by  Vinci [64]  It caters for much-increased passenger flows and provides greater integration between the intercity, suburban and underground sections of the station. The architect claimed that the roof is the longest single-span station structure in Europe and the semi-circular structure has a radius of 59 yards (54\u00a0m) and more than 2,000 triangular roof panels, half of which are glass. [59] The new concourse seen from above.  St. Pancras railway station  is to the right. Land between and behind Kings Cross and St Pancras stations is being redeveloped as  King's Cross Central  with around 2,000 new homes, 5,000,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (464,500\u00a0m 2 ) of offices and new roads. [65]  In the restoration, refurbished offices have opened on the east side of the station to replace ones lost on the west side, and a new platform, numbered 0, opened underneath them on 20 May 2010. [66]  Diesel trains cannot normally use this platform for environmental reasons. [67]  The restoration project was awarded a  European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award  in 2013. [68] [69] In May 2016, the  Office of Rail Regulation  approved a new operator,  East Coast Trains , to operate services to  Edinburgh Waverley  via  Stevenage Newcastle  and  Morpeth . The service is expected to start in 2021. [70] [71] [72] Future Remodelling edit In January 2018, it was announced that half the station would close for 3 months from January to March 2020 for remodelling work to the station and its approach, expected to cost \u00a3237 million. This includes rationalisation of the tracks, reopening the third tunnel to the approach of the station and closure of platform 10. [73] Accidents and incidents edit Main article:  List of accidents and incidents at London King's Cross railway station There have been many accidents at King's Cross over the years. The most serious were the  King's Cross railway accident  on 4 February 1945 which killed two people and injured 25. [38] [39]  and a collision in  Gasworks tunnel on 15 September 1881 which killed one person and seriously injured another. [29]   The most recent was on 17 September 2015 when a passenger train collided with the  buffer stops , injuring fourteen people. [74] [75] On 5 November 1979,  Martin Allen  was seen saying goodbye to his friends at King's Cross. He set off in the direction of the Piccadilly line platform, but he was never seen again. [76]  The station is also where  Andrew Gosden  was last seen before going missing on 14 September 2007. He had caught a train there from  Doncaster  under controversial and unexplained circumstances. [77] Other stations edit King's Cross York Road edit Class 105  at Kings Cross, York Road station on the last day of diesel services to Moorgate From 1863, part of King's Cross was an intermediate station. On the extreme east of the site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from  Finsbury Park  before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the  City Widened Lines  to  Farringdon Barbican  and  Moorgate . In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, [22]  to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the  Northern City Line  from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977. [78] Great Northern Cemetery Station edit The Great Northern Cemetery Station was built 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) to the east of the main station complex [79]  to transport coffins and mourners from the city to the burial grounds at  New Southgate Cemetery . The station opened in 1861 but was never profitable and closed in 1873.

In 2005, it was the busiest tube station, but has been overtaken by others since. [89]  It is in Travelcard Zone 1 and caters for both Kings Cross and the neighbouring  St. Pancras railway station The station opened as part of the first section of  Metropolitan Railway  project on 10 January 1863; the first part of the Underground to open. [90]  It was expanded to accommodate the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (now the  Piccadilly line ) in 1906, [91]  with the City & South London Railway (now the  Northern line ) opening a year later. [92] The  Victoria line  platforms were opened in 1968. [93]  A major expansion to accommodate  High Speed 1  at St Pancras opened in November 2009. [94] Cultural references edit In fiction edit Tourists at  Platform \u200b 9 3 4  in the western departures concourse The station is mentioned in Chapter\u00a02 of  E.M. Forster 's 1910 novel  Howards End , where it suggests \"infinity\" to the eldest Schlegel daughter, Margaret, and contrasted with the \"facile splendours\" of St. Pancras. [95]  In the Reverend  Wilbert Awdry 's 1957 children's book  The Eight Famous Engines Gordon the Big Engine  undertakes a journey to London, hoping to reach King's Cross, but ends up at St Pancras instead. [96] King's Cross features in the  Harry Potter  books, by  J. K. Rowling , as the starting point of the  Hogwarts Express . The train uses a secret  Platform \u200b 9 3 4  accessed through the brick wall barrier between platforms 9 and 10. [97]  In fact, platforms 9 and 10 are in a separate building from the main station and are separated by two intervening tracks. [98]  Instead, the brick roof-support arches between platforms 4 and 5 were redressed by the film crew and used to represent a brick wall that does not exist between the real platforms 9 and 10. [99] Within King's Cross, a cast-iron \"Platform \u200b 9 3 4 \" plaque was erected in 1999, initially in a passageway connecting the main station to the platform 9\u201311 annexe. Part of a luggage trolley was installed below the sign: the near end of the trolley was visible, but the rest had disappeared into the wall. The location quickly became a popular tourist spot amongst Harry Potter fans. [100]  The sign and a revamped trolley, complete with luggage and bird cage, were relocated in 2012, following the development of the new concourse building, and are now sited next to a Harry Potter merchandise shop. Because of the restrained facade of the real King's Cross station, the Harry Potter films showed St. Pancras in exterior station shots instead. [100] When the  Wizarding World of Harry Potter  at  Universal Orlando Resort  expanded to  Universal Studios Florida , the Wizarding Worlds in both Universal Studios Florida and  Islands of Adventure  were connected with the  Hogwarts Express [101] [102]  The Universal Studios Florida station is based on King's Cross station and Platform \u200b 9 3 4 , including a quarter-scale replica of the facade of King's Cross as the entrance to the station. [103] In film edit The station, its surrounding streets and the railway approach feature prominently in the 1955  Ealing comedy  film  The Ladykillers [104]  In the story, a gang robs a security van near the station after planning in a house overlooking the railway. When they fall out, members of the gang are dropped into passing goods wagons from the parapet of the  Copenhagen Tunnel  north of the station. [105] The 1986 crime drama film  Mona Lisa  is set around King's Cross. At the time, the downmarket and seedy area surrounding the station, coupled with  urban decay , made it an ideal location. Subsequent early 1990s  tabloid  coverage of crime and prostitution around King's Cross referred back to the film. [106] Pet Shop Boys  released a song titled \"King's Cross\" on the 1987 album  Actually  and the station was extensively filmed in for the group's 1988 feature film  It Couldn't Happen Here . The band's  Neil Tennant  explained that the station was a recognisable landmark coming into London, attempting to find opportunities away from the high unemployment areas of Northeast England at the time. The song was primarily about \"hopes being dashed\" and \"an epic nightmare\". [107]  The group subsequently asked filmmaker  Derek Jarman  to direct a background video for \"King's Cross\" for their 1989 tour, which featured a black and white sequence of juddery camera movements around the local area. [108] Monopoly edit King's Cross station is a square on the British  Monopoly  board. The other three stations in the game are  Marylebone Fenchurch Street  and  Liverpool Street , and all four were LNER termini at the time the game was being designed for the British market in the mid-1930s. [109] References edit Notes Lewis Cubitt  was also responsible for the design of the Great Northern Hotel (see below). To be extended to/from Maidstone East in December 2019.

The site has been the London terminus of services provided by the  Great Western Railway  and its successors since 1838. Much of the main line station dates from 1854 and was designed by  Isambard Kingdom Brunel Paddington is the London terminus of the  Great Western main line , operated today by  Great Western Railway , which provides the majority of commuter and regional passenger services to west London and the  Thames Valley  region as well as long-distance intercity services to  South West England  and  South Wales . It is also the terminus for the  Heathrow Express  and  TfL Rail  services to and from  Heathrow Airport . It is one of 11 London stations managed directly by  Network Rail . It is situated in  fare zone 1  and has two separate tube stations providing connections to the  Bakerloo Circle District , and  Hammersmith & City lines The station has been perennially popular for passengers and goods, particularly milk and parcels. Major upgrades took place in the 1870s, the 1910s and the 1960s, each trying to add additional platforms and space while trying to preserve the existing services and architecture as much as possible. Paddington was first served by London Underground trains in 1863, as the original western terminus of the  Metropolitan Railway , the world's first underground railway. In the 20th century, suburban and commuter services appeared at Paddington as the  urban sprawl  of London moved westwards. Despite the numerous upgrades and rebuilding, plus damage sustained in particular during  World War II , Brunel's original design is still recognisable.\n Contents 1 Location 2 History 2.1 Great Western Railway 2.2 Big Four, British Rail and privatisation 3 Services 4 Accidents and incidents 5 London Underground stations 6 Crossrail station 7 Cultural references 8 Gallery 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links Location edit Station location map. The Paddington\u00a0(underground) station marked here is the southern station on Praed Street. The station complex is bounded at the front by  Praed Street  and at the rear by Bishop's Bridge Road, which crosses the station throat on  Bishop's Bridge . On the west side of the station is Eastbourne Terrace, while the east side is bounded by the Paddington arm of the  Grand Union Canal . The station is in a shallow cutting, a fact obscured at the front by a hotel building, but which can be clearly seen from the other three sides. [4]  To the north of the station is the  Westway , to the northeast is  Edgware Road , and to the east and southeast is the  London Inner Ring Road [5] The surrounding area is partly residential, and includes the major  St Mary's Hospital , restaurants and hotels. Until recently there was little office accommodation in the area, and most commuters interchanged between  National Rail  and the  London Underground  to reach workplaces in the  West End  or the  City . However, recent redevelopment of derelict railway and canal land, marketed as  Paddington Waterside , has resulted in new office complexes nearby. [4] [6] The station is in  London fare zone 1 . In addition to the Underground stations at Paddington,  Lancaster Gate station  on the  Central line  is a short walk away to the south. A little further to the south lie the conjoined parks of  Hyde Park  and  Kensington Gardens [7]  Several  London Buses  routes, including Nos.\u00a0 23  and  205  serve the station. [8] History edit Layout of Paddington Station in 1888 The National Rail station is officially named  London Paddington , a name commonly used outside London but rarely by Londoners, who call it just  Paddington , as on the  London Underground map . This same practice applies to all the London mainline rail termini, except London Bridge. Parts of the station, including the main  train shed , date from 1854, when it was built by  Isambard Kingdom Brunel  as the London terminus for the  Great Western Railway  (GWR). It is one of eleven stations in London managed by  Network Rail [9] Great Western Railway edit After several false starts, Brunel announced the construction of a railway from Bristol to London on 30 July 1833. This became the GWR, and he intended it to be the best railway in the country. [10]  The GWR had originally planned to terminate London services at  Euston  as this allowed them to use part of the  London and Birmingham Railway 's track into the station, which would have been cost effective. [11]  This received government approval in 1835, but was rejected as a long-term solution by Brunel as he was concerned it would also allow  Liverpool  to compete as a port with Bristol if the railway from Birmingham was extended. [11] [12] The first station was a temporary terminus for the GWR on the west side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot. [13] [14]  Brunel did not consider that anything less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853. [15] Paddington Station in the Victorian era The main station between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was designed by Brunel, who was enthusiastic at the idea of being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate  Matthew Digby Wyatt .  He took inspiration from  Joseph Paxton 's  Crystal Palace  and the  M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof [16]  The glazed roof is supported by  wrought iron  arches in three spans, respectively spanning 68 feet (21\u00a0m), 102 feet (31\u00a0m) and 70 feet (21\u00a0m). The roof is 699 feet (210\u00a0m) long, and the original roof spans had two  transepts  connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate  traversers  to carry  coaches  between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown. [17] [14] [18]  The original station used four platforms, 27-foot (8.2\u00a0m)-wide and 24-foot-6-inch (7.47\u00a0m)-wide departure platforms, a 21-foot (6.4\u00a0m) arrival platform, and a 47-foot (14\u00a0m) combined arrival platform and cab road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic. [19] The first GWR service from the new station departed on 16 January 1854, though the roof had not been finished at this point and there were no arrivals. It was formally opened on 29 May, and the older temporary station was demolished the following year. [19] Praed Street facade of the Great Western Hotel (now the  Hilton London Paddington The  Great Western Hotel  was built on  Praed Street  in front of the station from 1851 to 1854 by architect  Philip Charles Hardwick , son of  Philip Hardwick  (designer of the  Euston Arch ) in a classical and French-chateau design. It opened on 9 June 1854, and had 103 bedrooms and 15 sitting rooms. Each corner contained a tower containing two additional floors beyond the five storeys of the main block. [19]  It was originally run by a consortium of GWR shareholders and staff, before the company took over operations completely in 1896. [20]  The station was substantially enlarged in 1906\u20131915 and a fourth span of 109 feet (33\u00a0m) was added on the north side, parallel to the others. The new span was built in a similar style to the original three spans, but the detailing is different and it has no transepts. [21] [22]  The area between the rear of the hotel and the concourse is called the Lawn. It was originally unroofed and occupied by sidings, but was later built up to form part of the station's first concourse. [23] [22] Paddington's capacity was doubled to four tracks in the 1870s. The quadrupling was completed to  Westbourne Park  on 30 October 1871,  Slough  in June 1879 and  Maidenhead  in September 1884. An additional platform (later to become No.\u00a09) opened in June 1878, while two new departure platforms (later Nos.\u00a04\u00a0and\u00a05) were added in 1885. [24]  One of the lines between what is now platform 5 and 7 was removed, in order that the latter could be moved to a more southerly position. Aside from the June 1878 work, Brunel's original roof structure remained untouched throughout the improvements. [25] The GWR began experimenting with the electric lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas lights that year. Although the system was unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and  Royal Oak  and  Westbourne Park  stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with  gas lighting  on the same scale. [25] Paddington became an important milk depot towards the end of the 19th century. A milk dock was built 1881, and by the 20th century over 3,000 churns were being handled at the station every day. Other goods such as meat, fish, horses and flowers were also transported through Paddington. Passenger traffic continued to improve as well. In March 1906, the goods depot at Westbourne Park was moved to  Old Oak Common . The main departure platform was extended in 1908 and used for milk and parcels. [26]  In 1911, work began to separate light and empty carriage traffic from running trains between Paddington to Old Oak Common, which involved the rebuilding of Westbourne Park station. The work was halted because of  World War I  but resumed in 1926, to be completed the following year. [27]  Three new platforms were added; platform 12 in November 1913, platform 11 in December 1915, and platform 10 the following year. [28]  The roof was completely reconstructed between 1922 and 1924, replacing Brunel's original cast-iron columns with steel replicas. [29] The GWR memorial Unlike several other London termini, Paddington saw no damage during  World War I . Although  Victoria  and  Charing Cross  were the main stations for military movement during the war, Paddington was used for some of this traffic, and a 24-hour buffet was available at the station. [28] On  Armistice Day  1922, a  memorial  to the employees of the GWR who died during the war was unveiled by  Viscount Churchill . The bronze memorial, depicting a soldier reading a letter, was sculpted by  Charles Sargeant Jagger  and stands on platform 1. [22] [30] Big Four, British Rail and privatisation edit The GWR was the only railway company that continued through the  Big Four  grouping in 1923. [12]  A tube railway for the Post Office, opened in December 1927, could cater for around 10,000 mailbags every day. [29] Paddington was extended again from 1930 to 1934. Platforms 2 to 11 were extended past the Bishop's Road bridge and a new parcel depot was built. [29]  Suburban services, which had never been considered important at Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos.\u00a013\u201316) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for suburban services next to the bridge. [31]  A public address system was introduced in 1936. [32]  By this time, around 22,000 parcels a day were being forwarded from Paddington, with the Royal Mail service processing around 4,500 mailbags and 2,400 parcel bags every day. [33] The station came under attack several times during  World War II . On 17 April 1941, the departure side of the station was hit by a parachute mine, while on 22 March 1944, the roof between platforms 6 and 7 was destroyed by two 500-pound (230\u00a0kg) flying bombs. [34]  Passenger traffic greatly increased through Paddington during the war, partly by evacuation to the relatively quiet  Thames Valley , and because holidaymakers chose to travel west as large areas of the south and east coasts had been taken over for military purposes. On 29 July 1944, the station was closed for three hours because the platforms were saturated with passenger traffic, while on the subsequent  August bank holiday , crowds were controlled in tight queues along Eastbourne Terrace by mounted police. [35] Statue of  Isambard Kingdom Brunel Steam traffic began to be replaced in the late 1950s. Between 1959 and 1961, suburban services switched to  diesel multiple units , while the last regular long-distance steam train left Paddington on 11 June 1965. [36]  The track layout was reorganised in 1967, abolishing the distinction between arrival and departure platforms that had been a feature of Paddington since opening. A new set of sidings was built south of Royal Oak, and the track curve into Paddington was eased. Services to the Midlands were rerouted via  Marylebone  during this time. The station concourse was enlarged in 1970, and the ticket office was rebuilt in the same year. [37]  By this time, public opinion had turned against wholesale demolition and redevelopment of stations such as Euston, and consequently the rebuilding work was done with an eye towards preserving Brunel and Wyatt's original station design. [38] [39]  Special steam services began to be run from Paddington again in the 1980s. [40] In 1982, a bronze statue of Brunel was erected on the station concourse. It was sculpted by John Doubleday and funded by the  Bristol and West Building Society [41]  Between 1989 and 1999, the Lawn was re-roofed and separated from the concourse by a glass screen wall. It is surrounded by shops and cafes on several levels. [22] [23] Paddington is now owned by  Network Rail . Train services were  privatised  in 1996, initially to Great Western Trains and  Thames Trains . The former company was renamed First Great Western in 1998, and merged with  First Great Western Link  and  Wessex Trains  to form the  Greater Western franchise  in 2006. In 2015, the operating company was renamed  Great Western Railway [42] The station's fourth span was renovated in 2010, involving repair and restoration of the original glazed roof, so that platforms 9 to 12 can once more enjoy daylight. [43]  A false ceiling or crash deck had been in place since 1996. Work was completed and the restored roof unveiled in July 2011. A second phase of improvements began in July 2014 and was completed two years later. [44]  Network Rail originally planned to demolish Span 4 and build an office block over that part of the station;  Save Britain's Heritage  successfully campaigned against this. [45] Among railwaymen, the narrow busy section of the incoming main railway line between  Ladbroke Grove  and Paddington station is called Paddington Throat.

Two services go to  Heathrow Airport : the  Heathrow Express  travels non-stop at a premium fare, while  TfL Rail  takes the same route but calls at most intermediate stations. [48] [49] The station has 13 terminal platforms, numbered 1 to 12 and 14 from south-west to north-east (left to right as seen from the concourse). Platforms 1 to 8 are below the original three spans of Brunel's train shed, platforms 9 to 12 beneath the later fourth span. Platform 13 was decommissioned in December 2016 to permit lengthening of platform 12 for 10 coach trains. Platform 14 is within the  Metropolitan Railway 's old Bishop's Road (Suburban) station to the north-west. Immediately alongside are through platforms 15 and 16, used by the  London Underground 's  Hammersmith & City  and  Circle  lines. [50]  The current operator, Great Western Railway, assigns numbers to the pocket timetables it publishes, and its services to Bath, Bristol, Weston-super-Mare and South Wales are in timetable number 1. [51] The concourse stretches across the heads of platforms 1 to 12, underneath the London end of the four train sheds. Platform 14 can only be reached indirectly via the north-western end of platform 12. A footbridge crosses the north-western end of the station and gives access to platforms 1\u201312 and 14. There are  ticket barriers  to platforms 2\u20135 and 10\u201316. [52] A first-class lounge on Platform 1 provides complimentary refreshments and Wi-Fi internet access. It also has screens showing television news as well as a departure board. [53] Train shed at Paddington Platforms 6 and 7 are dedicated to the  Heathrow Express [54]  Flight information display screens for airline passengers are provided at the Heathrow Express ticket office near these platforms. [55]  Baggage check-in facilities for airline passengers were provided in 1999 in the Lawn but progressively replaced by retail units. [56]  An integrated timetable is offered between Paddington and  Rosslare Europort  in Ireland via the  Stena Line  ferry from  Fishguard Harbour railway station  with through ticketing to stations and a daily morning and evening service in both directions, changing at Newport, Cardiff or Swansea. This route has been in existence since 1906. [57] [58] Paddington is the terminus for suburban trains to West London and the  Thames Valley , also operated by Great Western Railway.

When its  London Marylebone  terminus was closed, Chiltern Railways diverted its services to London Paddington as did  Wrexham & Shropshire  between 2008 and 2011. [64] [65] Accidents and incidents edit On 9 August 1920, a passenger train collided with the buffers. Two people were injured. [66]  The following year, a passenger train was being shunted into a platform and collided with three luggage vans already occupying the line. A carriage was derailed and a luggage van was wrecked. [67] On 23 November 1983, a sleeper train hauled by  Class 50  locomotive 50 041  Bulwark  was derailed on the approach to Paddington after speeding through a crossover. Three of the seventy passengers were injured. [68] [69] On 18 February 1991, Paddington was  bombed  by the  Provisional IRA , causing bad damage to the station's roof. Three hours later  London Victoria station  was targeted in a much more serious attack. [70] The worst accident at Paddington was the  Ladbroke Grove rail crash  (also called the Paddington rail crash). On 5 October 1999, a Thames Train stopping service from Paddington to  Bedwyn  passed a red signal and collided with a Great Western express travelling in the opposite direction. The drivers of both trains were killed, along with 29 passengers; 400 others were injured. [71] [72] On 25 May 2014, the middle coach of an empty stock  Class 360 electric multiple unit  360 205 derailed as it entered platform 3, due to maintenance errors. [73]  On 16 June 2016, a  Class 165 diesel multiple unit  165 124 passed a signal at danger and derailed in a siding, causing significant disruption to services and damage to infrastructure. [74]  On 20 August 2017, a  Class 43 , 43188 derailed during departure from Platform 2, when forming the rear power car of the 11:57 service to  Penzance [75] London Underground stations edit Main articles:  Paddington tube station (Bakerloo, Circle and District lines)  and  Paddington tube station (Circle and Hammersmith & City lines) The GWR were aware that Paddington was some distance away from the centre of London, and in 1854 donated \u00a3175,000 (\u00a316,134,000 as of 2018) to the  North Metropolitan Railway  in order that the station could have a link to the City. Consequently, Paddington was the original western terminus of the line when it opened on 1 January 1863. [20]  An extension to the Metropolitan Railway provided Paddington with a connection to south of the River Thames, opening from Praed Street Junction via a new  station at Paddington, located on Praed Street , to  Gloucester Road  on 1 October 1868. [76]  An extension of the  Baker Street and Waterloo Railway  to Paddington opened on 1 December 1913, connecting to the Metropolitan Railway's Praed Street station. [77] Because of the history of the various railways, Paddington is served by four  London Underground  lines through two separate stations: the  Bakerloo Circle  and  District  lines have a combined  sub-surface and deep-level station  on Praed Street to the south of the main line station, and the Circle and  Hammersmith & City  lines have a  sub-surface station  with access from  Paddington Basin  to the north. Circle line services run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the  London Underground map  as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked. [78] [79] [80] Lancaster Gate  Underground station on the  Central line  and  Marylebone  mainline station are within walking distance and out of station interchanges to these stations are permitted at no extra cost if made within the permitted time.

Eastbourne Terrace was closed in early 2012 for two years. A taxi rank is on the other side of the station, above platform 12. Crossrail services are due to start in autumn 2019. [81]  The new  station box  will be 23 metres (75\u00a0ft) deep and 260 metres (850\u00a0ft) long.

In the books, by  Michael Bond , he is found at the station, having come from \"deepest, darkest  Peru \" and with a note attached to his coat reading \"please look after this bear, thank you\". A statue of him by  Marcus Cornish , based on the original drawings by  Peggy Fortnum , is located under the clock on platform 1. [83] [84] [85] Paddington station has been referred to in several popular works of fiction. It is mentioned in several  Sherlock Holmes  novels. In  The Hound of the Baskervilles , Watson and his companions Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville leave for Dartmoor from Paddington, while in  The Boscombe Valley Mystery , Holmes and Watson leave the station for a train to Boscombe Valley near  Ross-on-Wye Herefordshire [86]  The mystery novel  4.50 From Paddington  (1957) by  Agatha Christie  begins with a murder witnessed by a passenger on a train from Paddington. [87]  One of  The Railway Series  books,  The Eight Famous Engines , contains a story about Gordon, Duck and a foreign engine debating which station London is. Duck says that he used to work at Paddington so he knows that Paddington is most important. However, Gordon later finds out that the station in London is  St Pancras [88]  There is a fictional underground Paddington station on the North London System in the novel  The Horn of Mortal Danger  (1980). [89] Paddington station was the subject of  William Powell Frith 's 1862 painting  The Railway Station . The portrait was viewed by over 21,000 people (paying a  shilling  each) in the first seven weeks of it being publicly shown. The painting is now held in the  Royal Holloway College [20] The band  Supertramp  used Paddington station to record the train sounds featured in the song \"Rudy\" on the 1974 album  Crime of the Century [90] There is a documentary television series about Paddington station on Channel 5 called  Paddington Station 24/7 [91] Gallery edit The station clock\n Platforms 1, 2 and 3 with First Great Western trains for the West of England and Wales\n First Great Western (local) and Heathrow Connect trains on the approach to Paddington.\n London Street entrance\n Central area and the area known as the Lawn\n Complimentary refreshments in the first class lounge\n Pannier tank on empty stock working in 1962\n Empty stock arriving in 1962\n InterCity 125  at Platform 1 in 1988\n Upper area in the Lawn\n The Lawn area\n References edit Citations \"London and South East\" (PDF) National Rail .

Moorgate  in the  City of London . Main line railway services for  Hertford Welwyn Garden City  and  Letchworth  are operated by  Great Northern , while the Underground station is served by the  Circle Hammersmith & City Metropolitan  and  Northern lines The station was opened as  Moorgate Street  in 1865 by the  Metropolitan Railway . In 1900, the  City & South London Railway  added the station to its network, and the Great Northern & City Railway began serving the station in 1904. In 1975, the  Northern City Line  platforms were the site of the  Moorgate tube crash  \u2013 at the time, the worst peacetime accident in the history of the London Underground \u2013 in which 43 people were killed.  Thameslink  branch services were withdrawn in the early 21st century, and  Crossrail  improvements will see Moorgate connected to  Liverpool Street Contents 1 Location and station layout 2 History 2.1 1861\u20131950 2.2 1950 \u2013 present 3 Accidents and incidents 4 Infrastructure 5 Services 5.1 London Underground 5.1.1 Circle line 5.1.2 Hammersmith and City line 5.1.3 Metropolitan line 5.1.4 Northern line 5.2 National Rail 5.2.1 Northern City Line 6 References 6.1 Citations 6.2 Sources 7 External links Location and station layout edit Sub-surface eastbound / clockwise, platform 1 at Moorgate station prior to Crossrail works The station has entrances on both Moorgate itself and  Moorfields , which runs parallel. The public entrances from the street give access to all the train services at the station, there are three distinct levels. [4] The  Circle Hammersmith & City  and  Metropolitan  underground lines use platforms 1 and 2, which are through platforms. [4]  For terminating trains at busy times, there are platforms 3 and 4 which are west-facing bays. Adjacent to these are platforms 5 and 6 of the former Thameslink trains service from  Bedford  via St Pancras. These are disused following the closure of the Moorgate branch from Farringdon junction as part of the  Thameslink Programme  and are now used for storage. [5] The  Northern line  of the Underground uses platforms 7 and 8, which are in a deep-level tube section of the station. [4] National Rail  services on the  Northern City Line  use platforms 9 and 10, which are terminal platforms. Train services run via the  East Coast Main Line  to Welwyn Garden City, and to  Hertford North , Stevenage, Hitchin or Letchworth. [6]  Because of this, Moorgate is part of the  London station group  and accepts tickets marked \"London Terminals\". [7] London Buses  routes  21 43 76 100 141 153 214  and  271  serve the station. [8] History edit 1861\u20131950 edit Plan of Moorgate Street station in 1886 The station was opened as Moorgate Street by the  Metropolitan Railway  as the first eastwards extension from the original terminus at  Farringdon . Parliamentary power had been obtained to build a station at Moorgate in 1861, two years before the initial section, and it was completed on 23 December 1865. Increased traffic from other companies, including goods traffic from the  Great Northern Railway , led to the line between  King's Cross  and Moorgate being widened to four tracks; the route was called the  City Widened Lines  and included a new tunnel at  Clerkenwell  which was 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m) lower than the original. The Widened Lines were open from Moorgate to Farringdon on 1 July 1866, and to King's Cross on 17 February 1868. [9]  Suburban services from the Midland Railway ran via Kentish Town and the Great Northern Railway ran via King's Cross. [10]  In 1874, director of the Metropolitan,  Edward Watkin , described Moorgate Street as \"your great terminus\" and recommended a 100-bedroom hotel should be built on top of the station. [11] The now Northern line platforms were originally part of an extension of the  City & South London Railway  (C&SLR) beyond  Borough  towards  Angel , forming the northern terminus of its services from  Stockwell  south of the  River Thames . An act for the extension had been authorised in 1893 and included an eastern diversion of the original line underneath the Thames. The new station opened on 25 February 1900. [12]  The line was extended to Angel on 17 November the following year. [13] The Northern City Line to Moorgate was opened by the Great Northern & City Railway (GN&CR) on 14 February 1904 offering a service to  Finsbury Park . It had an escalator connection to the other Moorgate platforms. The route was constructed in tube tunnels, but they were constructed at a diameter capable of accommodating main-line trains (in contrast to the majority of London tube tunnels which are much smaller). [14]  The line was the first to use automatic signalling throughout its length without any moving parts. Though a popular route, it went into decline after the Metropolitan Railway purchased the route on 1 July 1913. Consequently, the planned through services to the Great Northern Railway's main line were never implemented. [15] The CS&LR line (taken over by the Underground Group in 1913) closed services between Moorgate and  Euston  on 9 August 1922 in order to widen tunnels to 11 feet 8\u00bc inches (3.56 metres). The section from Moorgate to Clapham Common was worked on during the night while daytime services remained running, but closed completely on 28 November 1923 following a roof collapse at Newington Causeway the day before. Services to Euston opened on 20 April 1924, along with a connection to  Camden Town  and stations further north. Services to Clapham Common resumed on 1 December. [16]  The station was renamed from Moorgate Street to Moorgate on 24 October that year. [17] 1950 \u2013 present edit The Millfields entrance to Moorgate station British Rail  services to Moorgate were initially steam-operated. A commemorative service ran on 6 June 1971 from Moorgate to the depot at  Neasden , powered by a 0-6-0  tank locomotive [18]  Steam was replaced by Cravens-built diesel multiple units and  British Rail Class 31  locomotives class hauling non-corridor stock which remained in operation until 1976, when it was replaced with  British Rail Class 313  electrics. [19] The Northern City Line connection for Moorgate to Finsbury Park tube was closed beyond Drayton Park on 5 October 1964 to allow work on the  Victoria line . The line never re-opened fully, but instead the line was connected to the Finsbury Park  British Rail  station, in order to provide a connection for suburban services into Moorgate. The new service opened on 1 September 1968. [20] Moorgate station was completely modernised at platform level and street level in the 1960s, and the Widened Lines part of the station was extended to six platforms. The realignment of the platforms enabled about 500\u00a0yd (460\u00a0m) of the line to Barbican to be straightened and moved south to facilitate development of the  Barbican Estate [21] A heritage Metropolitan steam train at Moorgate station in 2014 British Rail (Eastern Region)  took over control of the Northern City Line from London Underground in 1975, as part of the Great Northern lines suburban electrification. The Highbury Branch of the Northern line was terminated. Services from Finsbury Park to Moorgate were diverted to the Northern City Line from the  City Widened Lines  the following year. [22]  The City Widened Lines were renamed the Moorgate line [23]  when overhead electrification was installed in 1982, allowing the Midland City Line service to run from Bedford via the Midland Main Line to Moorgate on the Thameslink service. [24] The Moorgate Thameslink branch was reduced to peak hours services only in 2003, and closed permanently on 20 March 2009 as part of the Thameslink Programme upgrades. [5]  The closure was required in order to lengthen the platforms at Farringdon to take the longer-carriage trains, which could only be done southward in the direction of Moorgate as there was too steep a gradient to the north. [25] Under the  Crossrail  plans running from 2011 to 2018, the western ticket hall of the scheme's  Liverpool Street  station will be situated just east of Moorgate station. An interchange will be built, linking Moorgate to the  Central line  at Liverpool Street. [26] Accidents and incidents edit Memorial plaque to the victims of the  Moorgate tube crash On 13 September 1905, a train derailed at the station. There were two injuries. [27] On 28 February 1975, 43 people were killed and 74 seriously injured in the  Moorgate tube crash , when a southbound Northern City Line train crashed into the end of the dead-end tunnel beyond the platform. The accident caused the most fatalities on the Underground during peacetime and has been considered the worst ever on the system. The cause was the unexplained failure of the driver to stop or even slow down at the platform, causing the train to run at speed into the dead-end tunnel, colliding with the buffers and then with the wall. [28] [29]  Services were immediately suspended, resuming on 1 March from Drayton Park to Old Street only. The wreckage was not fully cleared until 6 March and the station fully re-opened four days later. [30] Infrastructure edit Traction current  on the Underground lines is supplied by the standard London Underground  four rail system .\nTrains using the  deep level  Northern City Line platforms (9 and 10) are supplied with 750 V DC [31]  current via the  third rail , overseen by York Electrical Control Room. [31]  The signalling is  track circuit block , colour light signals with  tripcock mechanisms , controlled by Kings Cross  Power signal box [31] The former subsurface Thameslink bay platforms (5 and 6) were equipped with 25  kilovolt alternating current [23] overhead line equipment , overseen by York Electrical Control Room. [23]  Signalling was track circuit block, multiple aspect colour light signals, controlled by  West Hampstead PSB [23] Services edit London Underground edit The Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and Circle lines serve the station between  Barbican  to the west and Liverpool Street to the east.

The tunnel runs beneath the  Smithfield meat market  and was constructed using the  cut-and-cover  method immediately prior to the building of the market. The tunnel opened on 1 January 1866.\n Snow Hill tunnel was constructed by the  London, Chatham and Dover Railway  (LC&DR) to connect its tracks from the Ludgate Viaduct to those of the recently opened  Metropolitan Railway 's  Widened Lines  south of Farringdon station. To the north-west, the Widened Lines in turn connected to the tracks of the  Great Northern Railway  at  King's Cross  and the  Midland Railway  at  St Pancras  via tunnels running beneath the two main line  termini . Snow Hill tunnel thus provided the crucial link in the only north-south railway route through central  London , enabling cross-London passenger and goods services to be run by a number of main line railway companies.\n In 1871 an additional, eastwards tunnel was opened which had connection to the Metropolitan Railway's tracks, enabling trains from the south to also serve  Aldersgate  (now Barbican) and  Moorgate Street  (now Moorgate) stations. The eastward curve also connected to an extensive Great Western Railway  goods station  beneath Smithfield market (now a car park). This Smithfield Curve (which had a very tight radius and could not be used by bogie stock) closed in 1916. The goods station, like those of the GNR, Midland Railway and the Metropolitan Railway all located nearby, is no longer in use.\n 1914 map showing the area of Snow Hill tunnel. A station, also named  Snow Hill , was opened in the tunnel in 1874 providing an interchange with the LC&DR's adjacent terminus at  Holborn Viaduct station .  Snow Hill station closed in 1916 although the tunnel remained in use for goods traffic until the end of the 1960s. Tracks were lifted in 1971 and the tunnel was abandoned for fifteen years until works began in 1986 to bring the north-south route back into operation as part of the  Thameslink route . New tracks were laid in 1988 and services reopened in 1990. Initially it was expected that a new station would be built at the site, but this was transferred to what is now  City Thameslink  (originally called St Paul's Thameslink).\n Modern picture of Snow Hill Tunnel The southern end of the tunnel was originally adjacent to Holborn Viaduct station, with trains running on viaduct between there and  Blackfriars. As part of the Thameslink works, the viaduct was demolished and replaced with a new section of cut and cover tunnel reaching most of the way to Blackfriars, incorporating City Thameslink station. To provide clearance for the new tunnel, the road levels at the western end of Ludgate Hill and in the adjacent junction of Ludgate Circus were raised several feet so that the tunnel could pass below.\n A report in 2008 by the  Planning Inspectorate  into a proposed development of the General Market Building confirms that the tunnel structure, known as the lids, urgently required either repair or replacement. The tunnel lids are supported by girders which have deteriorated due to steam exhaust gases and, more recently, from wet conditions due to failed waterproofing of the decks above. Network Rail confirmed however that the condition of the structure is not dissimilar to many other structures of the same age on the network, and are comfortable that the structure is safe as it currently stands.\n See also edit Ludgate Hill railway station  - closed station on the viaduct a short distance north of Blackfriars station. It was demolished with the viaduct.

The company existed until 31 December 1922 when its assets were merged with those of other companies to form the  Southern Railway  as a result of the grouping  determined by the  Railways Act 1921 . The railway was always in a difficult financial situation and went bankrupt in 1867, but was able to continue to operate. Many of the difficulties were caused by the severe competition and duplication of services with the  South Eastern Railway  (SER). However, in 1898 the LCDR agreed with the SER to share the operation of the two railways, work them as a single system (as the  South Eastern and Chatham Railway ) and pool receipts: but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained separate companies with separate shareholders until both becoming constituents of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923.\n 'The Chatham', as it was sometimes known, was often criticised for its lamentable carriage stock and poor punctuality, but in two respects it was very good: it used the highly effective  Westinghouse air brake  on its passenger stock, and the Sykes 'Lock and Block' system of signalling. As a result, it had an excellent safety record.\n Contents 1 History 1.1 East Kent Railway 1.2 London, Chatham and Dover Railway 1.3 Second London line 1.4 Later openings 2 Insolvency 2.1 Background 2.2 Immediate cause of the insolvency 2.3 Samuel Morton Peto 2.4 Financial market reaction 2.5 Aftermath 3 Formation of the South Eastern & Chatham Railway 4 Line details 5 Rolling stock 6 Ships 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 9.1 Sources 10 External links History edit East Kent Railway edit Main article:  East Kent Railway Lordship Lane Station , an intermediate station on the  Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway , a LCDR branch line in London, by  Camille Pissarro  (1871) The LCDR originated through the dissatisfaction felt by the inhabitants and businesses of towns in north and east Kent with the services provided by the SER, resulting in the formation of the East Kent Railway (EKR). Permission to build a new  line  from  Strood  near  Rochester  to  Faversham  was granted by Parliament in 1853, but the SER successfully fought off an attempt by the new company to secure  running powers  over its metals. [1]  In return the SER agreed not to oppose any future application for an extension of the line to Dover, which was granted in 1855.\n It took the EKR several years to raise the necessary finance and it was not until 25 January 1858 when the first section of the line from  Chatham  to  Faversham  was opened, with stations at  Rainham Sittingbourne Teynham , and  Faversham . On 29 March 1858 a second section from  Strood  to Chatham. Around July 1858 a station opened at  New Brompton  (renamed  New Brompton (Gillingham)  in May 1886 and  Gillingham  from 1 October 1912).  Rochester station opened after the rival SER opened Chatham Central station.\n On 3 March 1858 the  West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway  (WELCPR) opened the extension of their line from Norwood (Crystal Palace) to Beckenham Junction (opened as Beckenham) and Shortlands  (opened as Bromley).\n On 22 November 1858 the  Mid-Kent Railway  constructed a line from New Beckenham to Beckenham Junction station and obtained running rights over the WELCPR to Bromley (Shortlands). From there the Crays Company was building a line on to Bromley South (opened as Bromley Common) and  Bickley  (opened as Southborough Road). The Mid Kent line connected with the WELCPR that later provided the necessary access to London. After absorbing the Crays Company and gaining running rights over the Mid Kent metals to Beckenham Junction, the LCDR was to later buy the track between Beckenham Junction, Birkbeck and Bromley Junction, while the LBSCR absorbed the rest of the WELCPR.\n In 1859 the EKR changed its name to the LCDR though Dover had not then been reached, coinciding with the Western Extension via Longfield to join the Crays Company metals at Southborough Road (now Bickley).

the line from Herne Hill to  Blackfriars Bridge  station (south of the river), was extended from  Elephant & Castle . The next year the LCDR crossed the Thames on a bridge and on 1 June 1865  Ludgate Hill  station opened (closed 3 March 1929). The line continued north under Snow Hill and a junction was made with the  Metropolitan Railway . On 1 January 1866, LCDR and  Great Northern Railways  (GNR) joint services from Blackfriars Bridge began operating via  Snow Hill tunnel  under Smithfield market to  Farringdon  and northwards on to the GNR. [2] In 1874 a terminus opened at  Holborn Viaduct . In 1886,  St. Paul's  station (later renamed Blackfriars) was opened by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, reached by a parallel bridge across the river.

These standard clauses also required that before any loans could be taken, all of the share capital must have been subscribed for, at least 50% paid for and the payment proved to the satisfaction of a  justice of the peace [4] The railway construction partnership  Peto and Betts  had done a lot of work already for the LCDR, some of it via a close but separate partnership between Sir  Morton Peto Edward Betts , and  Thomas Russell Crampton , the engineer for the LCDR. This new partnership, Peto, Betts and Crampton, in conjunction with the original partnership, Peto and Betts, agreed to build a line between London Bridge and Victoria for the LCDR and to be paid entirely in the company's shares and debentures.\n Immediate cause of the insolvency edit From its inception, the LCDR was known to be under capitalized. With the collapse of the bank  Overend, Gurney and Company  in May 1866, it became apparent that the LCDR had been funding its construction by operating a series of schemes to evade the loan restriction requirements and borrow money that was not secured in the way the law required.\n Shares had been issued in the names of Peto, Betts, Crampton and their acquaintances, and the LCDR accounts written up to make it look as though either the associated cash payment had been made directly to Peto and Betts to fund the construction of the line, or the money, having been paid to the railway company, had temporarily been lent back to the new shareholders. In fact, no cash had changed hands at all, but on the strength of these fictitious entries, the statutory declaration was made before a justice of the peace and authority given to raise loans. [5] Once these major irregularities were exposed, the financial markets refused to continue lending to the LCDR and it became insolvent.\n Samuel Morton Peto edit In December 1863  Samuel Morton Peto , a partner in Peto and Betts, had joined the board of the LCDR as financial advisor. With the collapse of the company the accusation was made that Peto was party to the scheme to circumvent the loan restrictions. [4] [6] At the time of the LCDR insolvency Peto was the  Liberal Member of Parliament  for Bristol, and on 22 October 1866 addressed a meeting in Bristol to explain his involvement with the LCDR. Although reports of the meeting are very complimentary and sympathetic to Peto, further contemporary analysis was less so. [4] [6] At the Bristol meeting, Peto was quite open with his admission that his business, Peto and Betts, was party to a scheme where they would give the LCDR a receipt for money paid to them as contractors, and the LCDR gave Peto and Betts a counter-receipt for money paid \"for deposit, and in anticipation of calls.\" It was made to appear that share capital had been paid which had not been paid. On the strength of these fictitious receipts, again, the statutory declaration was made before a justice of the peace and authority given to raise loans. [4] However, Peto did not consider himself in any way to be at any fault. In his view, as it was the LCDR company solicitors that had suggested this course of action, and had drawn up the fraudulent statutory declaration and the loan documentation papers, he did not think that he should shoulder any of the blame. [4]  When they heard how Peto had implicated them, the company solicitors retorted that they had never done anything of the kind, and that they regarded any attempt to borrow money, except on the basis of \"a bona fide subscription and a bona fide payment of half the capital,\" as \"utterly indefensible.\" [4] Peto\u2019s attitudes were not unique. One of his supporters (and himself a railway director and deputy chairman) made a statement to the meeting to the effect that railway boards of directors cannot afford to be too nice, \"It is very difficult to make a railway out of nothing \u2026 Parliamentary requirements almost necessitate the doing of things which are not strictly right and proper.\" [4] Financial market reaction edit Financial commentators were scandalised. Typical of the comments published were:\n Of course, we may expect to hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an experienced man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament. [4] Whom shall we in future trust? Here is Sir Morton Peto, saying expressly, \u2018These debentures are not debentures; I do not know what they are, but debentures they are not. I got money on them, it is true, but they are not worth anything. They are only quasi things, and the good debentures are elsewhere.\u2019 We have never seen the whole basis of railway credit so rudely shaken. We could not have believed that such a defence could have been offered. How is Lombard-street ever to rely on having good debentures, when it finds men of the greatest repute and the highest standing offering it documents so very like debentures, but after all not real? ... Of course the company was primarily responsible; but Sir Morton Peto was acting as their trusted financial agent, ... and therefore he must be held responsible, not of course exclusively, but conjointly with those with whom he acted.\" [7] Aftermath edit The LCDR was refinanced. The original shareholders lost their investment and the board of directors and company solicitors replaced. The new board resolved to pursue Peto, Betts and Crampton and made a \"staggering\" [8]  claim against them personally for \u00a36,661,941 19s 1d. [8]  (equivalent to \u00a3606,210,000 as of 2018). [9] Peto, Betts and Crampton admitted to owing the LCDR \u00a3365,000 and eventually the railway acquiesced to this figure. The railway\u2019s new solicitors declared, \"Whether my clients had a proof upon the proceedings for \u00a3360,000 or for \u00a36,600,000, the result would, unfortunately be the same \u2013 in neither case would there be any dividend.\" [5]  The Pall Mall Gazette commented, \"\u2026 the chase was costly and the game worthless.\" [5] The personal reputations of Peto and Betts were destroyed and never recovered. Although also made personally bankrupt, Crampton came out of the episode with his reputation intact and continued in business.\n Formation of the South Eastern & Chatham Railway edit Main article:  South Eastern and Chatham Railway On 1 January 1899 the  South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee  was formed to oversee joint working. On 5 August 1899 the  South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railway Companies  Act was passed, which resulted in the formation of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR). This was not a true merger since each company kept its individual board of directors within the organisation.\n The rolling stock and steamboats of the two companies were thereafter worked as one concern.  Some rationalisation of competing stations occurred but it was not fully resolved. Between 1902 and 1904, connections were built to allow LCDR trains through running on ex-SER lines, notably in the Bickley area where the two main lines crossed. The rationalisation of the lines in Thanet to create a line which ran through from Margate via Ramsgate to Minster did not take place until after the  grouping . In 1936 the former tunnel to Ramsgate Harbour became part of the  Tunnel Railway  underground railway system linking Ramsgate beach to Hereson Road, near  Dumpton Park  mainline station.\n In 1923 the LCDR and the  South Eastern Railway  (SER), the  London, Brighton and South Coast Railway  (LBSCR), and the  London and South Western Railway  (LSWR) were joined to form the  Southern Railway Line details edit Principal engineering works Blackfriars Bridge : 933\u00a0ft (284\u00a0m) long Grosvenor Bridge : 930\u00a0ft (283\u00a0m) Viaduct carrying extension to Blackfriars: 742 brick arches, 94 girder bridges Steepest gradient Rochester Bridge \u00a0\u2014 Sole Street: 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) at 1:100 (1%) Tunnels Lydden, or Shepherd's Well Tunnel: 2,376\u00a0yd (2,173\u00a0m) Penge Tunnel, adjacent to Sydenham Hill: 2,141\u00a0yd (1,958\u00a0m) [10]  \u2013 this was allegedly Queen Victoria's least favourite tunnel Locomotive Works The locomotive works were at  Longhedge , in  Battersea , and the old erecting shop can still be seen. The former SER works at  Ashford  took over locomotive building for the joint concern, but some building work at Longhedge continued for a few years. The London, Chatham and Dover Railway Tavern, in nearby Cabul Road is widely regarded as having the longest traditional pub name in Britain. citation needed Rolling stock edit Both the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railway companies' locomotives were painted black each with their own style of lining but, when taken over by the South Eastern and Chatham Railways Managing Committee (SE&CR), dark green was adopted with an elaborate lining scheme. After some trials with a hybrid colour scheme (SER maroon on the upper parts and LC&DR teak on the lower), the SE&CR adopted the dark maroon/lake livery for passenger stock. Ex-LC&DR locomotives were renumbered by adding 459 to the running numbers (i.e. locomotive No 1 became No 460, etc.); SER locomotives retained their existing numbers.\n For a small and indigent company the Chatham was lucky in its locomotive engineers. After a very patchy start, with a miscellany of Cramptons and other oddities, it had two very competent engineers. clarification needed William Martley  was appointed in 1860, and commissioned some very effective performers, notably the 0-4-2 well tanks of the 'Scotchmen' (1866) and 'Large Scotchmen' (1873) classes for the suburban services; and the 'Europa' class (1873) of 2-4-0s, which ran the mail trains to and from Dover, the Chatham's crack service.\n William Kirtley  came from the Midland Railway in 1874, following the death of Martley. He was the nephew of  Matthew Kirtley , the Midland's famous locomotive superintendent. Kirtley produced a series of excellent designs, robust and good performers\u00a0\u2014 the A series of 0-4-4 tanks for suburban services, the B series of 0-6-0 goods engines; the T class of shunting engines; the M series of 4-4-0 express passenger engines; and a final R series of enlarged 0-4-4 tanks.\n These rather than Stirling's Ashford products formed the basis for SE&CR development under Wainwright, not least because it was Robert Surtees from  Longhedge  who led design work for the successor organisation. The R series led to the SE&CR's R1 and subsequent H class; the Bs to the famous C class; and the Ms to the D and E classes, which in their rebuilt Maunsell form may have been the best British inside-cylinder 4-4-0s.\n Ships edit The London, Chatham and Dover Railway operated a number of steamships from 1864, when they took over Jenkins & Churchward's fleet.

 in the  City of London  that was opened on 1 June 1865 by the  London, Chatham and Dover Railway  (LC&DR) as its City terminus. It was situated on Ludgate Viaduct (a railway viaduct) between  Queen Victoria Street  and  Ludgate Hill , slightly north of  St. Paul's station  (now called Blackfriars station) on the site of the former  Fleet Prison [1] Ludgate Hill and surrounding streets in 1888 Ludgate Hill station (remains), with RCTS rail tour in 1953. The station in 1865 North of Ludgate Hill station, Ludgate Viaduct continued to the  Snow Hill tunnel  to connect with the then recently opened  Metropolitan Railway  south of  Farringdon station  to enable main-line trains to run between north and south London.\n Passenger services through the tunnel ended in 1916, after which services north of Ludgate Hill station ran only the few hundred yards to  Holborn Viaduct station  which had opened in 1874. Ludgate Hill became little used because of its proximity to the Holborn Viaduct and St. Paul's stations, and on 3 March 1929 Ludgate Hill was closed. The platform buildings remained derelict until they were demolished in the 1960s but the island platform remained until 1974. Remains of the street-level buildings and traces of the platform and staircase lasted until the whole station area and viaduct were demolished in 1990.\n In the 1970s, in the Fleet line proposal, preparatory work began for  Ludgate Circus Underground station  very near the site of the former Ludgate Hill station, but it was abandoned when a different alignment was chosen for the  Jubilee line , as it later became known.\n An office building now stands at the station site, above a new tunnel which connects the old Snow Hill tunnel and Blackfriars station for  Thameslink  services.  City Thameslink station  in the new tunnel has a southern exit at Ludgate Circus, roughly on the site of the old Ludgate Hill station.\n Preceding station\n Disused railways\n Following station\n Holborn Viaduct Line and station closed London, Chatham & Dover Railway City branch Blackfriars Line and station open A 1914  Railway Clearing House  map of lines around Ludgate Hill railway station See also edit List of closed railway stations in London References edit Timbs, John  (1855).

It was founded in 1833, received its enabling  Act of Parliament  on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838. It was engineered by  Isambard Kingdom Brunel , who chose a  broad gauge  of  7\u00a0ft 2,134\u00a0mm )\u2014later slightly widened to  7\u00a0ft\u00a0 1 4 \u00a0in 2,140\u00a0mm )\u2014but, from 1854, a series of  amalgamations  saw it also operate  4\u00a0ft\u00a0 8 1 2 \u00a0in 1,435\u00a0mm standard-gauge  trains; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892. The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the  Railways Act 1921 , which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory, and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was  nationalised  and became the  Western Region of British Railways The GWR was called by some \"God's Wonderful Railway\" and by others the \"Great Way Round\" but it was famed as the \"Holiday Line\", taking many people to  English  and  Bristol Channel  resorts in the  West Country  as well as the far south-west of  England  such as  Torquay  in Devon,  Minehead  in Somerset, and  Newquay  and  St Ives  in  Cornwall . The company's locomotives, many of which were built in  the company's workshops at Swindon , were painted a  Brunswick green  colour while, for most of its existence, it used a two-tone \"chocolate and cream\" livery for its passenger coaches. Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey.\n Great Western trains included long-distance express services such as the  Flying Dutchman , the  Cornish Riviera Express  and the  Cheltenham Spa Express . It also operated many suburban and rural services, some operated by  steam railmotors  or  autotrains . The company pioneered the use of larger, more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain. It operated a network of  road motor (bus) routes , was a part of the  Railway Air Services , and owned ships, docks and hotels.\n Contents 1 History 1.1 Formation 1.2 Route of the line 1.3 Brunel's 7-foot gauge and the \"gauge war\" 1.4 Into the 20th century 1.5 One of the \"Big Four\" 1.6 World War II and after 2 Geography 2.1 Key locations 2.2 Engineering features 3 Operations 3.1 Passenger services 3.2 Freight services 3.3 Ancillary operations 4 Motive power and rolling stock 4.1 Locomotives 4.2 Carriages 4.3 Wagons 5 Track 6 Signalling 7 Cultural impact 7.1 Tourism 7.2 Art, media and literature 7.3 Heritage 7.4 Locomotives named  Great Western 8 Notable people 8.1 Chairmen 8.2 Others 9 See also 10 References 11 Further reading 12 External links History edit Formation edit The interior of Brunel's train-shed at Temple Meads, the first Bristol terminus of the GWR, from an engraving by  J.\u00a0C.\u00a0Bourne The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of  Bristol  merchants to maintain their city as the second port of the country and the chief one for American trade. The increase in the size of ships and the gradual silting of the  River Avon  had made  Liverpool  an increasingly attractive port, and with a Liverpool to London rail line under construction in the 1830s Bristol's status was threatened. The answer for Bristol was, with the co-operation of London interests, to build a line of their own; a railway built to unprecedented standards of excellence to out-perform the lines being constructed to the  North West of England [4] The company was founded at a public meeting in Bristol in 1833 and was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1835.  Isambard Kingdom Brunel , then aged twenty-nine, was appointed engineer.\n Route of the line edit This was by far Brunel's largest contract to date. He made two controversial decisions. Firstly, he chose to use a broad gauge of  7\u00a0ft 2,134\u00a0mm ) to allow for the possibility of large wheels outside the bodies of the rolling stock which could give smoother running at high speeds. Secondly, he selected a route, north of the  Marlborough Downs , which had no significant towns but which offered potential connections to  Oxford  and  Gloucester . This meant the line was not direct from to London to Bristol. From Reading heading west, the line would curve in a northerly sweep back to Bath.\n Brunel surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself, with the help of many, including his solicitor Jeremiah Osborne of Bristol law firm  Osborne Clarke  who on one occasion rowed Brunel down the River Avon himself to survey the bank of the river for the route. [5] [6] George Thomas Clark  played an important role as an engineer on the project, reputedly taking the management of two divisions of the route including bridges over the  River Thames  at  Lower Basildon  and  Moulsford  and of  Paddington Station [7]  Involvement in major earth-moving works seems to have fed Clark's interest in geology and  archaeology  and he, anonymously, authored two guidebooks on the railway: one illustrated with  lithographs  by  John Cooke Bourne [8]  the other, a critique of Brunel's methods and the broad gauge. [9] The  Sonning Cutting  in 1846 The first  22 1 2  miles (36\u00a0km) of line, from Paddington station in London to  Maidenhead Bridge station , opened on 4 June 1838. When  Maidenhead Railway Bridge  was ready the line was extended to  Twyford  on 1 July 1839 and then through the deep  Sonning Cutting  to  Reading  on 30 March 1840. The cutting was the scene of a railway disaster two years later when a goods train ran into a  landslip ; ten passengers who were travelling in open trucks were killed.  This accident  prompted  Parliament  to pass the  1844 Railway Regulation Act  requiring railway companies to provide better carriages for passengers. The next section, from Reading to  Steventon  crossed the Thames twice and opened for traffic on 1 June 1840. A  7 1 4 -mile (12\u00a0km) extension took the line to  Faringdon Road  on 20 July 1840. Meanwhile, work had started at the Bristol end of the line, where the  11 1 2 -mile (19\u00a0km) section to  Bath  opened on 31 August 1840. [10] Route of the Great Western Railway on  Cheffin's Map , 1850. The sweep to the north from Reading is clearly seen. On 17 December 1840, the line from London reached a temporary terminus at  Wootton Bassett Road  west of Swindon and 80.25 miles (129\u00a0km) from Paddington. The section from Wootton Bassett Road to  Chippenham  was opened on 31 May 1841, as was  Swindon Junction station  where the  Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway  (C&GWUR) to  Cirencester  connected. That was an independent line worked by the GWR, as was the  Bristol and Exeter Railway  (B&ER), the first section of which from Bristol to  Bridgwater  was opened on 14 June 1841. The GWR main line remained incomplete during the construction of the 1-mile-1,452-yard (2.94\u00a0km)  Box Tunnel , which was ready for trains on 30 June 1841, after which trains ran the 152 miles (245\u00a0km) from Paddington through to Bridgwater. [11]  In 1851, the GWR purchased the  Kennet and Avon Canal , which was a competing carrier between London, Reading, Bath and Bristol. [12] The GWR was closely involved with the C&GWUR and the B&ER and with several other broad-gauge railways. The  South Devon Railway  was completed in 1849, extending the broad gauge to  Plymouth [13]  whence the  Cornwall Railway  took it over the  Royal Albert Bridge  and into  Cornwall  in 1859 [14]  and, in 1867, it reached  Penzance  over the  West Cornwall Railway  which originally had been laid with the  4\u00a0ft\u00a0 8 1 2 \u00a0in 1,435\u00a0mm standard gauge  or \"narrow gauge\" as it was known at the time. [15]  The  South Wales Railway  had opened between  Chepstow  and  Swansea  in 1850 and became connected to the GWR by Brunel's  Chepstow Bridge  in 1852. It was completed to  Neyland  in 1856, where a transatlantic port was established. [16] There was initially no direct line from London to Wales as the tidal  River Severn  was too wide to cross. Trains instead had to follow a lengthy route via Gloucester, where the river was narrow enough to be crossed by a bridge. Work on the  Severn Tunnel  had begun in 1873, but unexpected underwater springs delayed the work and prevented its opening until 1886.

He later added  1 4  inch (6.4\u00a0mm), probably to reduce friction of the wheel sets in curves. This became the  7\u00a0ft\u00a0 1 4 \u00a0in 2,140\u00a0mm ) broad gauge. [18]  Either gauge may be referred to as \"Brunel's\" gauge.\n In 1844, the broad-gauge  Bristol and Gloucester Railway  had opened, but Gloucester was already served by the  4\u00a0ft\u00a0 8 1 2 \u00a0in 1,435\u00a0mm standard gauge  lines of the  Birmingham and Gloucester Railway . This resulted in a  break of gauge  that forced all passengers and goods to change trains if travelling between the south-west and the North. This was the beginning of the \"gauge war\" and led to the appointment by  Parliament  of a Gauge Commission, which reported in 1846 in favour of standard gauge so the 7-foot gauge was proscribed by law ( Regulating the Gauge of Railways Act ) except for the south-west of England and Wales where connected to the GWR network. Other railways in Britain were to use standard gauge. In 1846 the Bristol and Gloucester was bought by the  Midland Railway  and it was converted to standard gauge in 1854, which brought  mixed-gauge  track to Temple Meads station\u00a0\u2013 this had three rails to allow trains to run on either broad or standard gauge. [19] The GWR extended into the  West Midlands  in competition with the Midland and the  London and North Western Railway Birmingham  was reached through  Oxford  in 1852 and  Wolverhampton  in 1854. [20]  This was the furthest north that the broad gauge reached. [21]  In the same year the  Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway  and the  Shrewsbury and Chester Railway  both  amalgamated  with the GWR, but these lines were standard gauge, [12]  and the GWR's own line north of Oxford had been built with mixed gauge. This mixed gauge was extended southwards from Oxford to  Basingstoke  at the end of 1856 and so allowed through goods traffic from the north of England to the south coast (via the  London and South Western Railway \u00a0\u2013 LSWR) without  transshipment [20] Broad and standard mileage operated by GWR [1] [2] Key Broad  gauge\u00a0\u2013  blue  (top) Mixed  gauge\u00a0\u2013  green  (middle) Standard  gauge\u00a0\u2013  orange  (bottom) Values to chart  31 December Broad Mixed Standard  1851 \u00a0269 miles (433\u00a0km) \u00a03 miles (5\u00a0km) \u00a00 miles (0\u00a0km)  1856 \u00a0298 miles (480\u00a0km) \u00a0124 miles (200\u00a0km) \u00a075 miles (121\u00a0km)  1861 \u00a0327 miles (526\u00a0km) \u00a0182 miles (293\u00a0km) \u00a081 miles (130\u00a0km)  1866 \u00a0596 miles (959\u00a0km) \u00a0237 miles (381\u00a0km) \u00a0428 miles (689\u00a0km)  1871 \u00a0524 miles (843\u00a0km) \u00a0141 miles (227\u00a0km) \u00a0655 miles (1,054\u00a0km)  1876 \u00a0268 miles (431\u00a0km) \u00a0274 miles (441\u00a0km) \u00a01,481 miles (2,383\u00a0km)  1881 \u00a0210 miles (340\u00a0km) \u00a0254 miles (409\u00a0km) \u00a01,674 miles (2,694\u00a0km)  1886 \u00a0187 miles (301\u00a0km) \u00a0251 miles (404\u00a0km) \u00a01,918 miles (3,087\u00a0km)  1891\u00a0 \u00a0171 miles (275\u00a0km)\u00a0 \u00a0252 miles (406\u00a0km)\u00a0 \u00a01,982 miles (3,190\u00a0km)\u00a0  The line to Basingstoke had originally been built by the  Berks and Hants Railway  as a broad-gauge route in an attempt to keep the standard gauge of the LSWR out of Great Western territory but, in 1857, the GWR and LSWR opened a shared line to  Weymouth  on the south coast, the GWR route being via Chippenham and a route initially started by the  Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway [20]  Further west, the LSWR took over the broad-gauge  Exeter and Crediton Railway  and  North Devon Railway [22]  also the standard-gauge  Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway . It was several years before these remote lines were connected with the parent LSWR system and any through traffic to them was handled by the GWR and its associated companies. [23] By now the gauge war was lost and mixed gauge was brought to  Paddington  in 1861, allowing through passenger trains from London to Chester. The broad-gauge South Wales Railway amalgamated with the GWR in 1862, as did the  West Midland Railway , which brought with it the  Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway , a line that had been conceived as another broad-gauge route to the Midlands but which had been built as standard gauge after several battles, both political and physical. On 1 April 1869, the broad gauge was taken out of use between Oxford and Wolverhampton and from Reading to Basingstoke. In August, the line from  Grange Court  to  Hereford  was converted from broad to standard and the whole of the line from Swindon through Gloucester to South Wales was similarly treated in May 1872. In 1874, the mixed gauge was extended along the main line to Chippenham and the line from there to Weymouth was narrowed. The following year saw mixed gauge laid through the Box Tunnel, with the broad gauge now retained only for through services beyond Bristol and on a few branch lines. [24] The  Bristol and Exeter Railway  amalgamated with the GWR on 1 January 1876. It had already made a start on mixing the gauge on its line, a task completed through to  Exeter  on 1 March 1876 by the GWR. The station here had been shared with the LSWR since 1862. This rival company had continued to push westwards over its Exeter and Crediton line and arrived in Plymouth later in 1876, which spurred the  South Devon Railway  to also amalgamate with the Great Western. The  Cornwall Railway  remained a nominally independent line until 1889, although the GWR held a large number of shares in the company. One final new broad-gauge route was opened on 1 June 1877, the  St Ives branch  in west  Cornwall , although there was also a small extension at  Sutton Harbour  in Plymouth in 1879. [15]  Part of a mixed gauge point remains at Sutton Harbour, one of the few examples of broad gauge trackwork remaining in situ anywhere. [25] Once the GWR was in control of the whole line from London to Penzance, it set about converting the remaining broad-gauge tracks. The last broad-gauge service left Paddington station on Friday, 20 May 1892; the following Monday, trains from Penzance were operated by standard-gauge locomotives. [26] Into the 20th century edit New corridor coaches on the Cornish Riviera Express After 1892, with the burden of operating trains on two gauges removed, the company turned its attention to constructing new lines and upgrading old ones to shorten the company's previously circuitous routes. The principal new lines opened were: [27] 1900:  Stert and Westbury  linking the Berks and Hants line with  Westbury  to create a shorter route to  Weymouth  for the  Channel Islands  traffic. 1903: the  South Wales and Bristol Direct Railway  from  Wootton Bassett  to link up with the Severn Tunnel. 1904: a diversion of the  Cornish Main Line  between  Saltash  and  St Germans , eliminating the last  wooden viaducts on the main line 1906: the  Langport and Castle Cary Railway  to shorten the journey from London to  Penzance  between  Reading  and  Taunton 1908: the  Birmingham and North Warwickshire  which, combined with the Cheltenham and Honeybourne of 1906, offered a new route from Birmingham via  Stratford-upon-Avon  to south Wales. 1910: the Birmingham Direct Line built jointly with the  Great Central Railway  to give a shorter route from London to  Aynho  and the North. 1913: the Swansea District Lines which allowed trains to  Fishguard Harbour  to avoid  Swansea . Fishguard had been opened in an attempt to attract transatlantic liner traffic and provided a better facility for the Anglo-Irish ferries than that at Neyland. The generally conservative GWR made other improvements in the years before the  World War I  such as restaurant cars, better conditions for third class passengers, steam heating of trains, and faster express services. These were largely at the initiative of T. I. Allen, the Superintendent of the Line and one of a group of talented senior managers who led the railway into the  Edwardian era : Viscount Emlyn ( Earl Cawdor , Chairman from 1895 to 1905); Sir Joseph Wilkinson (general manager from 1896 to 1903), his successor, the former chief engineer Sir James Inglis; and  George Jackson Churchward  (the  Chief Mechanical Engineer ). It was during this period that the GWR introduced  road motor services  as an alternative to building new lines in rural areas, and started using  steam rail motors  to bring cheaper operation to existing branch lines. [27] One of the \"Big Four\" edit See also:  List of constituents of the Great Western Railway 1923 saw the construction of the first of 171  Castle Class  locomotives At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the GWR was taken into government control, as were most major railways in Britain. Many of its staff joined the armed forces and it was more difficult to build and maintain equipment than in peacetime. After the war, the government considered permanent  nationalisation  but decided instead on a compulsory  amalgamation  of the railways into four large groups. The GWR alone preserved its name through the \" grouping \", under which smaller companies were amalgamated into four main companies in 1922 and 1923.\n The new Great Western Railway had more routes in Wales, including 295 miles (475\u00a0km) of former  Cambrian Railways  lines and 124 miles (200\u00a0km) from the  Taff Vale Railway . A few independent lines in its English area of operations were also added, notably the  Midland and South Western Junction Railway , a line previously working closely with the  Midland Railway  but which now gave the GWR a second station at Swindon, along with a line that carried through-traffic from the North via  Cheltenham  and  Andover  to  Southampton The 1930s brought hard times but the company remained in fair financial health despite the  Depression . The  Development (Loans, Guarantees and Grants) Act 1929  allowed the GWR to obtain money in return for stimulating employment and this was used to improve stations including  London Paddington Bristol Temple Meads  and  Cardiff General ; to improve facilities at  depots  and to lay additional tracks to reduce congestion. The road motor services were transferred to local bus companies in which the GWR took a share but instead, it participated in  air services [28] A legacy of the broad gauge was that trains for some routes could be built slightly wider than was normal in Britain and these included the 1929-built \" Super Saloons \" used on the  boat train  services that conveyed transatlantic passengers to London in luxury. [29]  When the company celebrated its centenary during 1935, new \"Centenary\" carriages were built for the Cornish Riviera Express, which again made full use of the wider  loading gauge  on that route. [30] World War II and after edit With the outbreak of  World War II  in 1939, the GWR returned to direct government control, and by the end of the war a Labour government was in power and again planning to nationalise the railways. After a couple of years trying to recover from the ravages of war, the GWR became the  Western Region  of  British Railways  on 1 January 1948. The Great Western Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years, being formally  wound up  on 23 December 1949. [31]  GWR designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and the region maintained its own distinctive character, even painting for a while its stations and express trains in a form of chocolate and cream. [32] [33] About 40 years after nationalisation  British Rail  was  privatised  and the old name was revived by  Great Western Trains , the  train operating company  providing passenger services on the old GWR routes to South Wales and the South West, which subsequently became First Great Western as part of the  FirstGroup  but in September 2015 changed its name to  Great Western Railway  in order to 'reinstate the ideals of our founder'. [34]  The operating infrastructure, however, was transferred to  Railtrack  and has since passed to  Network Rail . These companies have continued to preserve appropriate parts of its stations and bridges so historic GWR structures can still be recognised around the network.\n Geography edit Map of the system circa 1930 The original  Great Western Main Line  linked  London Paddington station  with Temple Meads station in Bristol by way of  Reading Didcot Swindon Chippenham  and  Bath . This line was extended westwards through  Exeter [35]  and  Plymouth [13]  to reach  Truro [14]  and  Penzance [15]  the most westerly railway station in England. Brunel and Gooch placed the GWR's main  locomotive workshops  close to the village of Swindon and the locomotives of many trains were changed here in the early years. Up to this point the route had climbed very gradually westwards from London, but from here it changed into one with steeper gradients which, with the primitive locomotives available to Brunel, was better operated by types with smaller wheels better able to climb the hills. These gradients faced both directions, first dropping down through  Wootton Bassett  to cross the  River Avon , then climbing back up through Chippenham to the Box Tunnel before descending once more to regain the River Avon's valley which it followed to Bath and Bristol. [36] Swindon was also the junction for a line that ran north-westwards to  Gloucester  then south-westwards on the far side of the  River Severn  to reach  Cardiff Swansea  and west Wales. This route was later shortened by the opening of a more direct east\u2013west route through the Severn Tunnel. Another route ran northwards from Didcot to  Oxford  from where two different routes continued to  Wolverhampton , one through  Birmingham  and the other through  Worcester . Beyond Wolverhampton the line continued via  Shrewsbury  to  Chester  and  Birkenhead ; another route via  Market Drayton  enabled the GWR to reach  Crewe . Operating agreements with other companies also allowed GWR trains to run to  Manchester . South of the London to Bristol main line were routes from Didcot to  Southampton  via  Newbury , and from Chippenham to  Weymouth  via  Westbury [37] A network of cross-country routes linked these main lines, and there were also many and varied  branch lines . Some were short, such as the  3 1 2 -mile (5.6\u00a0km)  Clevedon branch line [38]  others were much longer such as the 23-mile (37\u00a0km)  Minehead Branch [39]  A few were promoted and built by the GWR to counter competition from other companies, such as the  Reading to Basingstoke Line  to keep the  London and South Western Railway  away from  Newbury [20]  However, many were built by local companies that then sold their railway to their larger neighbour; examples include the  Launceston [40]  and  Brixham [41]  branches. Further variety came from the traffic carried: holidaymakers ( St Ives [42]  royalty ( Windsor [43]  or just goods traffic ( Carbis Wharf [44] Brunel envisaged the GWR continuing across the Atlantic Ocean and built the  SS Great Western  to carry the railway's passengers from Bristol to New York. [45]  Most traffic for North America soon switched to the larger port of  Liverpool  (in  LNWR  territory) but some transatlantic passengers were landed at  Plymouth  and conveyed to London by special train. Great Western ships linked Great Britain with Ireland, the  Channel Islands  and France. [46] Key locations edit The railway's headquarters were established at Paddington station. Its locomotives and rolling stock were built and maintained at  Swindon Works [10]  but other workshops were acquired as it  amalgamated  with other railways, including the Shrewsbury companies'  Stafford Road works  at Wolverhampton, [47]  and the South Devon's workshops at  Newton Abbot [48] Worcester Carriage Works  was created by flattening land north of  Worcester Shrub Hill Station [49] Reading Signal Works  was established in buildings to the north of  Reading railway station [50]  and in later years a concrete manufacturing depot was established at  Taunton  where items ranging from track components to bridges were cast. [51] Engineering features edit Maidenhead Railway Bridge More than 150 years after its creation, the original main line has been described by an historian as  one of the masterpieces of railway design. [52]  Working westwards from Paddington, the line crosses the valley of the  River Brent  on  Wharncliffe Viaduct  and the  River Thames  on  Maidenhead Railway Bridge , which at the time of construction was the largest span achieved by a brick arch bridge. [53]  The line then continues through  Sonning Cutting  before reaching Reading [54]  after which it crosses the Thames twice more, on  Gatehampton  and  Moulsford  bridges. [55]  Between Chippenham and Bath is  Box Tunnel , the longest railway tunnel driven by that time. [56]  Several years later, the railway opened the even longer Severn Tunnel to carry a new line between England and Wales beneath the  River Severn [17] Some other notable structures were added when smaller companies were amalgamated into the GWR. These include the  South Devon Railway sea wall [57]  the  Cornwall Railway 's  Royal Albert Bridge [58]  and  Barmouth Bridge  on the  Cambrian Railways [59] Operations edit In the early years the GWR was managed by two committees, one in Bristol and one in London. They soon combined as a single board of directors which met in offices at Paddington. [10] The Board was led by a chairman and supported by a  Secretary  and other \"officers\". The first Locomotive Superintendent was  Daniel Gooch , although from 1915 the title was changed to Chief Mechanical Engineer. The first Goods Manager was appointed in 1850 and from 1857 this position was filled by  James Grierson  until 1863 when he became the first general manager. In 1864 the post of Superintendent of the Line was created to oversee the running of the trains.

[3] [61] Early trains offered passengers a choice of  first-  or second-class  carriages . In 1840 this choice was extended: passengers could be conveyed by the slow  goods trains  in what became third-class. The  1844 Railway Regulation Act  made it a legal requirement that the GWR, along with all other British railways, had to serve each station with trains which included third-class accommodation at a  fare  of not more than one  penny  per mile and a speed of at least 12\u00a0mph (19\u00a0km/h). By 1882, third-class carriages were attached to all trains except for the fastest  expresses . Another parliamentary order meant that trains began to include smoking carriages from 1868. [62] Special \" excursion \" cheap-day  tickets  were first issued in May 1849 and  season tickets  in 1851. Until 1869 most revenue came from second-class passengers but the volume of third-class passengers grew to the extent that second-class facilities were withdrawn in 1912. The  Cheap Trains Act 1883  resulted in the provision of workmen's trains at special low fares at certain times of the day. [3] The principal express services were often given nicknames by railwaymen but these names later appeared officially in timetables, on headboards carried on the locomotive, and on roofboards above the windows of the carriages. For instance, the late-morning  Flying Dutchman  express between London and Exeter was named after the winning horse of the  Derby  and  St Ledger races  in 1849. Although withdrawn at the end of 1867, the name was revived in 1869\u00a0\u2013 following a request from the  Bristol and Exeter Railway \u00a0\u2013 and the train ran through to Plymouth. An afternoon express was instigated on the same route in June 1879 and became known as  The Zulu . A third West Country express was introduced in 1890, running to and from Penzance as  The Cornishman . A new service, the  Cornish Riviera Express  ran between London and Penzance\u00a0\u2013 non-stop to Plymouth\u00a0\u2013 from 1 July 1904, although it ran only in the summer during 1904 and 1905 before becoming a permanent feature of the timetable in 1906.\n The  Cheltenham Flyer  was a GWR 'book for boys of all ages'. The  Cheltenham Spa Express  was the fastest train in the world when it was scheduled to cover the 77.25 miles (124.3\u00a0km) between  Swindon  and London at an average of 71.3 miles per hour (114.7\u00a0km/h). [63]  The train was nicknamed the 'Cheltenham Flyer' and featured in one of the GWR's 'Books for boys of all ages'. Other named trains included  The Bristolian , running between London and Bristol from 1935, [64]  and the  Torbay Express , which ran between London and  Kingswear [65] Many of these fast expresses included special coaches that could be detached as they passed through stations without stopping, a  guard  riding in the coach to uncouple it from the main train and bring it to a stop at the correct position. The first such \" slip coach \" was detached from the  Flying Dutchman  at  Bridgwater  in 1869. [50]  The company's first  sleeping cars  were operated between Paddington and Plymouth in 1877. Then on 1 October 1892 its first  corridor train  ran from Paddington to Birkenhead, and the following year saw the first trains heated by steam that was passed through the train in a pipe from the locomotive. May 1896 saw the introduction of first-class  restaurant cars  and the service was extended to all classes in 1903. Sleeping cars for third-class passengers were available from 1928. [62] Self-propelled \" steam railmotors \" were first used on 12 October 1903 between  Stonehouse  and  Chalford ; within five years 100 had been constructed. These trains had special retractable steps that could be used at stations with lower platforms than was usual in England. [50]  The railmotors proved so successful on many routes that they had to be supplemented by trailer cars with driving controls, the first of which entered service at the end of 1904. From the following year a number of small locomotives were fitted so that they could work with these trailers, the combined sets becoming known as \" autotrains \" and eventually replacing the steam rail motors. [66] Diesel railcars  were introduced in 1934. Some railcars were fully streamlined, some had buffet counters for long-distance services, and others were purely for parcels services.

[3] [61] Passenger traffic was the main source of revenue for the GWR when it first opened but goods were also carried in separate trains. It was not until the coal-mining and industrial districts of Wales and the Midlands were reached that goods traffic became significant; in 1856 the  Ruabon  Coal Company signed an agreement with the GWR to transport coal to London at special rates which nonetheless was worth at least \u00a340,000 each year to the railway. [3]  As locomotives increased in size so did the length of goods trains, from 40 to as many as 100 four-wheeled wagons, although the gradient of the line often limited this. [50]  While typical goods wagons could carry 8, 10 or (later) 12 tons, the load placed into a wagon could be as little as 1 ton. The many smaller consignments were sent to a local  transhipment  centre where they were re-sorted into larger loads for the main segment of their journey. There were more than 550 \"station truck\" workings running on timetabled goods trains carrying small consignments to and from specified stations, and 200 \"pick up\" trucks that collected small loads from groups of stations. [68] The GWR provided special wagons, handling equipment and storage facilities for its largest traffic flows. For example, the coal mines in Wales sent much of their coal to the docks along the coast, many of which were owned and equipped by the railway, as were some in Cornwall that exported most of the  china clay  production of that county. The wagons provided for both these traffic flows (both those owned by the GWR and the mining companies) were fitted with end doors that allowed their loads to be tipped straight into the ships' holds using wagon-tipping equipment on the dockside. Special wagons were produced for many other different commodities such as  gunpowder aeroplanes , milk, fruit and fish. [69] Heavy traffic was carried from the agricultural and fishing areas in the south west of England, often in fast \"perishables\" trains, [70]  for instance more than 3,500 cattle were sent from  Grampound Road  in the 12 months to June 1869, [71]  and in 1876 nearly than 17,000  tons  of fish was carried from west Cornwall to London. [72]  The perishables trains running in the nineteenth century used wagons built to the same standards as passenger coaches, with  vacuum brakes  and large wheels to allow fast running. Ordinary goods trains on the GWR, as on all other British railways at the time, had wheels close together (around 9 feet (2.7\u00a0m) apart), smaller wheels and only hand brakes. In 1905 the GWR ran its first vacuum-braked general goods train between London and Bristol using newly built goods wagons with small wheels but vacuum brakes. This was followed by other services to create a network of fast trains between the major centres of production and population that were scheduled to run at speeds averaging 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). Other railway companies also followed the GWR's lead by providing their own vacuum-braked (or \"fitted\") services. [73] Ancillary operations edit One of the first  road motors  working a service from  Helston  to  The Lizard A number of canals, such as the  Kennet and Avon Canal  and the  Stratford-upon-Avon Canal , became the property of the railway when they were purchased to remove competition or objectors to proposed new lines. Most of these continued to be operated although they were only a small part of the railway company's business: in 1929 the canals took \u00a316,278 of receipts while freight trains earned over \u00a317 million. (\u00a3972,000 and \u00a31.02\u00a0billion respectively in 2018). [74] [61] The  Railways Act 1921  brought most of the large coal-exporting docks in South Wales into the GWR's ownership, such as those at  Cardiff Barry , and  Swansea . They were added to a small number of docks along the south coast of England which the company already owned, to make it the largest docks operator in the world. [28] Powers were granted by Parliament for the  GWR to operate ships  in 1871. [28]  The following year the company took over the ships operated by Ford and Jackson on the route between  Neyland  in Wales and  Waterford  in Ireland. The Welsh terminal was relocated to  Fishguard Harbour  when the railway was opened to there in 1906. Services were also operated between  Weymouth Quay  and the  Channel Islands  from 1889 on the former Weymouth and Channel Islands Steam Packet Company routes. Smaller GWR vessels were also used as  tenders  at  Plymouth Great Western Docks  and, until the Severn Tunnel opened, on the  River Severn  crossing of the  Bristol and South Wales Union Railway [46] The first railway-operated bus services were started by the GWR between  Helston railway station  and  The Lizard  on 17 August 1903. Known by the company as \" road motors \", these chocolate-and-cream buses operated throughout the company's territory on railway feeder services and excursions until the 1930s when they were transferred to local bus companies (in most of which the GWR held a  share [75] The GWR inaugurated the first railway air service between  Cardiff Torquay  and  Plymouth  in association with  Imperial Airways . This grew to become part of the  Railway Air Services [28] Motive power and rolling stock edit Locomotives edit Main article:  Locomotives of the Great Western Railway Broad gauge  Iron Duke Class  locomotive  Hirondelle , built in 1848 The GWR's first locomotives were specified by  Isambard Kingdom Brunel  but proved unsatisfactory. Daniel Gooch, who was just 20 years old, was soon appointed as the railway's Locomotive Superintendent and set about establishing a reliable fleet. He bought  two locomotives  from  Robert Stephenson and Company  which proved more successful than Brunel's, and then designed a series of standardised locomotives. From 1846 these could be built at the company's newly established  railway workshops at Swindon . He designed several different  7\u00a0ft 2,134\u00a0mm broad-gauge  types for the growing railway, such as the  Firefly 2-2-2s  and later  Iron Duke Class 4-2-2s . In 1864 Gooch was succeeded by  Joseph Armstrong  who brought his  standard-gauge  experience to the railway. Some of Armstrong's designs were built as either broad or standard gauge just by fitting different wheels; those needing tenders were given old ones from withdrawn broad-gauge locomotives. [76] Joseph Armstrong's early death in 1877 meant that the next phase of motive power design was the responsibility of  William Dean  who developed express  4-4-0  types rather than the single-driver  2-2-2s  and  4-2-2s  that had hauled fast trains up to that time. [47]  Dean retired in 1902 to be replaced by  George Jackson Churchward , who introduced the familiar  4-6-0  locomotives. It was during Churchward's tenure that the term \"Locomotive Superintendent\" was changed to \"Chief Mechanical Engineer\" (CME). [77] Charles Collett  succeeded Churchward in 1921. He was soon responsible for the much larger fleet that the GWR operated following the  Railways Act 1921  mergers. He set about replacing the older and less numerous classes, and rebuilding the remainder using as many standardised GWR components as possible. He also produced many new designs using standard parts, such as the  Castle  and  King  classes. [78]  The final CME was  Frederick Hawksworth  who took control in 1941, seeing the railway through wartime shortages and producing GWR-design locomotives until after nationalisation. [47] Brunel and Gooch both gave their locomotives names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies that became a part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had  named broad-gauge locomotives  and numbered standard-gauge ones. From the time of Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives\u00a0\u2013 both broad and standard\u00a0\u2013 were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. [76]  Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger  tender  locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the  6000 class  and castles for the  4073 class [79] The GWR first painted its locomotives a dark  holly  green but this was changed to middle chrome or  Brunswick green  for most of its existence. They initially had chocolate brown or Indian red frames but this was changed in the twentieth century to black. Name and number plates were generally of polished brass with a black background, and chimneys often had copper rims or \"caps\". [80] Liveries through the years: Iron Duke s tender: Holly green with pea green lining\n City of Truro : Middle Chrome green, orange lining and red frames\n Nunney Castle : Middle Chrome green, orange lining and black frames\n 3850 : Middle Chrome green, black frames but no lining\n Carriages edit Main article:  Coaches of the Great Western Railway A coach in the chocolate and cream livery used from 1922 GWR passenger coaches were many and varied, ranging from four- and six-wheeled vehicles on the original  broad-gauge  line of 1838, through to  bogie  coaches up to 70 feet (21\u00a0m) long which were in service through to 1947 and beyond. Vacuum brakes, bogies and  through-corridors  all came into use during the nineteenth century, and in 1900 the first electrically lit coaches were put into service. The 1920s saw some vehicles fitted with automatic  couplings  and steel bodies.\n Early vehicles were built by a number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at  Swindon railway works , which eventually provided most of the railway's  rolling stock . Special vehicles included  sleeping cars restaurant cars  and  slip coaches [81]  Passengers were also carried in  railmotors [82] autotrains [66]  and  diesel railcars [67]  Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk at express speeds. [83]  Representative examples of these carriages survive in service today on various  Heritage railways  up and down the country.\n Most coaches were generally painted in variations of a chocolate-brown and cream livery, however they were plain brown or red until 1864 and from 1908 to 1922. [84]  Parcels vans and similar vehicles were seldom painted in the two-colour livery, being plain brown or red instead, which caused them to be known as \"brown vehicles\". [83] Wagons edit Main article:  Great Western Railway wagons A GWR goods van in the grey livery used from about 1904. This one has end doors to allow motor cars to be loaded. In the early years of the GWR its wagons were painted brown, [85]  but this changed to red before the end of the  broad gauge . The familiar dark grey livery was introduced about 1904. [86] Most early wagons were four-wheeled open vehicles, although a few six-wheeled vehicles were provided for special loads. Covered vans followed, initially for carrying cattle but later for both general and vulnerable goods too. The first  bogie  wagons appeared in 1873 for heavy loads, but bogie coal wagons were built in 1904 following on from the large four-wheel coal wagons that had first appeared in 1898. Rated at 20\u00a0 tons  (20.3\u00a0tonnes) these were twice the size of typical wagons of the period, but it was not until 1923 that the company invested heavily in coal wagons of this size and the infrastructure necessary for their unloading at their docks; these were known as \" Felix Pole \" wagons after the GWR's general manager who promoted their use. Container wagons appeared in 1931 and special vans for motor cars in 1933. [69] When the GWR was opened no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with  vacuum brakes , instead handbrakes were fitted to individual wagons and trains also conveyed  brake vans  where a guard had control of a screw-operated brake. The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed the majority of the fleet in 1948 when the railway was  nationalised  to become a part of  British Railways [87] All wagons for public traffic had a  code name  that was used in  telegraphic  messages. As this was usually painted onto the wagon it is common to see them referred to by these names, such as \"Mink\" (a van), \"Mica\" (refrigerated van), \"Crocodile\" (boiler truck), and \"Toad\" ( brake van [88] Track edit Main article:  Baulk road Baulk road track For the  permanent way  Brunel decided to use a light bridge rail continuously supported on thick timber baulks, known as \" baulk road \". Thinner timber transoms were used to keep the baulks the correct distance apart. This produced a smoother track and the whole assembly proved cheaper than using conventional sleepers for broad-gauge track, although this advantage was lost with standard- or mixed-gauge lines because of the higher ratio of timber to length of line. More conventional track forms were later used, although baulk road could still be seen in sidings in the first half of the twentieth century. [89] Signalling edit Disc and crossbar signal Brunel developed a system of \"disc and crossbar\"  signals  to control train movements, but the people operating them could only assume that each train reached the next signal without stopping unexpectedly. The world's first commercial  telegraph  line was installed along the 13 miles (21\u00a0km) from Paddington to  West Drayton  and came into operation on 9 April 1839. This later spread throughout the system and allowed stations to use telegraphic messages to tell the people operating the signals when each train arrived safely. [90]  A long list of  code words  were developed to help make messages both quick to send and clear in meaning. [88] More conventional  semaphore signals  replaced the discs and crossbars over time. The GWR persisted with the lower quadrant form, where a \"proceed\" aspect is indicated by lowering the signal arm, despite other British railways changing to an upper quadrant form. Electric light signals of the \"searchlight\" pattern were later introduced at busy stations; these could show the same red/green or yellow/green aspects that semaphore signals showed at night. An \" automatic train control \" system was introduced from 1906 which was a safety system that applied a train's brakes if it passed a danger signal. [91] Cultural impact edit The GWR is known admiringly to some as \"God's Wonderful Railway\", [92]  but jocularly to others as the \"Great Way Round\" [93]  as some of its earliest routes were not the most direct. The railway, however, promoted itself from 1908 as \"The Holiday Line\" as it carried huge numbers of people to  resorts  in Wales and south-west England. [94] [95] [96] Tourism edit 1934  camp coach  brochure Cheap tickets were offered and excursion trains operated to popular destinations and special events such as the 1851  Great Exhibition [97]  Later,  GWR road motors  operated tours to popular destinations not served directly by train, and its ships offered cruises from places such as Plymouth. [98]  Redundant carriages were converted to  camp coaches  and placed at country or seaside stations such as  Blue Anchor  and  Marazion  and hired to holidaymakers who arrived by train.\n The GWR had operated hotels at major stations and junctions since the early days, but in 1877 it opened its first \"country house hotel\", the  Tregenna Castle  in  St Ives, Cornwall [50]  It later added the Fishguard Bay Hotel in Wales and the Manor House at  Moretonhampstead , Devon, to which it added a  golf course  in 1930. [28] It promoted itself from 1908 as \"The Holiday Line [99]  through a series of posters,  postcards jigsaw puzzles , and books. These included  Holiday Haunts , describing the attraction of the different parts of the GWR system, [100]  and regional titles such as  S. P. B. Mais 's  Cornish Riviera  and A. M. Bradley's  South Wales: The Country of Castles . Guidebooks described the scenery seen  Through the Window  of their trains. Other GWR books were designed to encourage an interest in the GWR itself. Published as \"Books for Boys of All Ages\", these included  The 10:30 Limited  and  Loco's of the Royal Road [101] The Great Western Railway effectively created the modern day tourist spots of the  West Country  and the southwest part of  Wales  that had previously been very difficult to reach. The Bristol Channel resorts of Wales and the West Country such as  Minehead  or the cliffs of  Exmoor  had been very remote from other parts of England before the advent of the GWR. [102] Art, media and literature edit Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway , by  Turner The GWR attracted the attention of the artists from an early date.  John Cooke Bourne 's  History and Description of the Great Western Railway  was published in 1846 and contained a series of detailed  lithographs  of the railway that give readers a glimpse of what the line looked like in the days before photography. [8] J. M. W. Turner  painted his  Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway  in 1844 after looking out of the window of his train on  Maidenhead Railway Bridge [103]  and in 1862  William Powell Frith  painted  The Railway Station , a large crowd scene on the  platform  at Paddington. The station itself was initially painted for Powell by W Scott Morton, an architect, and a train was specially provided by the GWR for the painting, in front of which a variety of travellers and railway staff form an animated focal point. [104] The GWR has featured in many television programmes, such as the BBC children's drama series  God's Wonderful Railway  in 1980. [105]  It was also immortalised in  Bob Godfrey 's animated film  Great , which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 1975 which tells the story of Brunel's engineering accomplishments. [106] Sir John Betjeman  mentions the GWR clearly in his poem  Distant Views of a Provincial Town [107] The old Great Western Railway shakes, \nThe old Great Western Railway spins \u2013 \nThe old Great Western Railway makes \nMe very sorry for my sins.\n Heritage edit Main article:  List of Great Western Railway heritage sites A GWR seat at  Yatton The pedestrian crossing at Cockwood Steps, on the South Devon Main Line, retains a gate with GWR spear-type railings The GWR's memory is kept alive by several museums such as  STEAM \u2013 the museum of the GWR  (in the old  Swindon railway works ), and the  Didcot Railway Centre , where there is an operating broad-gauge train.  Preserved  GWR lines include those from  Totnes to Buckfastleigh Paignton to Kingswear Bishops Lydeard to Minehead Kidderminster to Bridgnorth  and  Cheltenham to Broadway . Many other heritage railways and museums also have GWR locomotives or rolling stock in use or on display.\n Numerous stations owned by  Network Rail  also continue to display much of their GWR heritage. This is seen not only at the large stations such as  Paddington  (built 1851, [108]  extended 1915) [109]  and  Temple Meads  (1840, [110]  1875 [111]  & 1935) [112]  but other places such as  Bath Spa  (1840), [113] Torquay  (1878), [114] Penzance  (1879), [115] Truro  (1897), [116]  and  Newton Abbot  (1927). [117]  Many small stations are little changed from when they were opened, as there has been no need to rebuild them to cope with heavier traffic; good examples can be found at  Yatton  (1841),  Frome  (1850, Network Rail's last surviving Brunel-style  train shed [113] Bradford-on-Avon  (1857), and  St Germans  (1859). [118]  Even where stations have been rebuilt, many fittings such as signs,  manhole  covers and seats can still be found with \"GWR\" cast into them. [119] The Great Western Main Line was considered as a potential  UNESCO World Heritage Site  in 2006 but rejected in 2011. [120]  The proposal comprised seven sites:  Temple Meads  (including Brunel's GWR offices, boardroom, train shed, the  B&ER  offices, and the  bridge over the River Avon ); Bath (including the route from Twerton Tunnel to Sydney Gardens); Middlehill and  Box  Tunnels; the Swindon area including  Swindon railway works  and village;  Maidenhead Railway Bridge Wharncliffe Viaduct ; and Paddington station. [121] Locomotives named  Great Western edit The nameplate on  First Great Western power car 43185 Several locomotives have been given the name  Great Western . The first was an  Iron Duke class  broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company's  Swindon locomotive works . This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive in the same class was given the same name; this was withdrawn four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. [122]  A standard-gauge  3031 class  locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was  Castle class  number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days. [123] The name later reappeared on some  BR diesels . The first was 47500 which carried the name from 1979 until 1991. [124]  Another  Class 47 , this time 47815, had the name bestowed on it in 2005; it is currently (2009) in operation with  Riviera Trains [125]  A  High Speed Train power car , number 43185, also carries the same name; [123]  it is currently, and appropriately, a part of the modern  Great Western Railway  fleet.

It became the third-largest railway undertaking in the British Isles (after the  Great Western Railway  and the  London and North Western Railway [3] Contents 1 Origins 2 Consolidation 3 The South-West 4 Eastern competition 5 The Battle of Nottingham 6 The Euston Square Confederacy 7 To London 7.1 King's Cross 1857 \u2013 1868 7.2 St. Pancras 1868 8 To Manchester 9 To Scotland 10 Later history 11 Acquisitions 12 Accidents and incidents 13 Ships 14 Grouping 15 Chief posts in the Midland Railway 15.1 Chairmen 15.2 General Managers 15.3 Locomotive Superintendents and Chief Mechanical Engineers 15.4 Resident Engineers 15.5 Solicitors 16 See also 17 References 18 Sources 19 Further reading 20 External links Origins edit Midland Railway insignia on London Road bridge, Leicester The Midland Railway originated from 1832 in  Leicestershire Nottinghamshire , with the purpose of serving the needs of local coal owners. [4] The company was formed on 10 May 1844 by the merger of the  Midland Counties Railway , the  North Midland Railway , and the  Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway , the  Birmingham and Gloucester Railway  joined two years later. [5]  These met at the  Tri-Junct station  at Derby, where the MR established its  locomotive  and later its  carriage and wagon  works.\n Leading it were   George Hudson  from the North Midland, dynamic but unscrupulous, and  John Ellis  from the Midland Counties, a careful businessman of impeccable integrity.  James Allport  from the  Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway  found a place elsewhere in Hudson's empire with the  York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway , though he later returned. [6] The MR was in a commanding position having its Derby headquarters at the junctions of the two main routes from London to Scotland, by its connections to the  London and Birmingham Railway  in the south, and from  York  via the  York and North Midland Railway  in the north. citation needed Consolidation edit Almost immediately it took over the  Sheffield and Rotherham Railway  and the  Erewash Valley Line  in 1845, the latter giving access to the  Nottinghamshire  and  Derbyshire  coalfields. It absorbed the  Mansfield and Pinxton Railway  in 1847, building the  Erewash Valley Line  from the latter between  Chesterfield  and  Trent Junction  at  Long Eaton , completed to Chesterfield in 1862, giving access to the coalfields that became its major source of income. Passengers from  Sheffield  continued to use  Rotherham Masborough  until a direct route was completed in 1870.\n Meanwhile, it extended its influence in the  Leicestershire  coalfields, by buying the  Leicester and Swannington Railway  in 1846, [7] page\u00a0needed  and extending it to Burton in 1849.\n The South-West edit Curzon Street railway station in Birmingham After the merger, London trains were carried on the shorter Midland Counties route. The former  Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway  was left with the traffic to Birmingham and  Bristol , an important seaport. The original 1839 line from Derby had run to  Hampton-in-Arden : the  Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway  had built a terminus at  Lawley Street  in 1842, and on 1 May 1851 the MR started to run into  Curzon Street [8] The line south was the  Birmingham and Bristol Railway , which reached Curzon Street via  Camp Hill . These two lines had been formed by the merger of the  standard gauge Birmingham and Gloucester Railway  and the  broad gauge Bristol and Gloucester Railway citation needed They met at  Gloucester  via a short loop of the  Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway . The change of gauge at Gloucester meant that everything had to be transferred between trains, creating chaos, and the C&GWU was owned by the  Great Western Railway , which wished to extend its network by taking over the Bristol to Birmingham route.  While the two parties were bickering over the price, the MR's John Ellis overheard two directors of the  Birmingham and Bristol Railway  on a London train discussing the business, and pledged that the MR would match anything the Great Western would offer. [9] page\u00a0needed Since it would have brought broad gauge into Curzon Street with the possibility of extending it to the Mersey, it was something that the other standard gauge lines wished to avoid, and they pledged to assist the MR with any losses it might incur. [9] page\u00a0needed  In the event all that was necessary was for the later  LNWR  to share  Birmingham New Street  with the Midland when it was opened in 1854, and  Lawley Street  became a goods depot. [10] Eastern competition edit The MR controlled all the traffic to the North East and Scotland from London. The LNWR was progressing slowly through the Lake District, and there was pressure for a direct line from London to York. Permission had been gained for the  Northern and Eastern Railway  to run through  Peterborough  and  Lincoln  but it had barely reached  Cambridge Two obvious extensions of the Midland Counties line were from  Nottingham  to Lincoln and from  Leicester  to Peterborough. They had not been proceeded with, but Hudson saw that they would make ideal \"stoppers\": if the cities concerned were provided with a rail service, it would make it more difficult to justify another line. They were approved while the bill for the direct line was still before Parliament, forming the present day  Lincoln Branch  and the  Syston to Peterborough Line The  Leeds and Bradford Railway  had been approved in 1844. By 1850 it was losing money but a number of railways offered to buy it. Hudson made an offer more or less on his own account and the line gave the MR an exit to the north, which became the start of the Settle and Carlisle line, and it gave the MR a much more convenient station at  Leeds Wellington citation needed In spite of the objections of Hudson, for the MR and others, the \"London and York Railway\" (later the  Great Northern Railway ) led by  Edmund Denison  persisted, and the bill passed through Parliament in 1846. [11] The Battle of Nottingham edit In 1851 the  Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway  completed its line from  Grantham  as far as  Colwick , from where a branch led to the MR Nottingham station. The  Great Northern Railway  by then passed through Grantham and both railway companies paid court to the fledgling line. Meanwhile, Nottingham had woken up to its branch line status and was keen to expand. The MR made a takeover offer only to discover that a shareholder of the  GN  had already gathered a quantity of Ambergate shares. An attempt to amalgamate the line with the  GN  was foiled by Ellis, who managed to obtain an  Order in Chancery  preventing the GN from running into Nottingham. However, in 1851 it opened a new service to the north that included Nottingham. [12] page\u00a0needed In 1852 an  ANB&EJR  train arrived in Nottingham with a  GN  locomotive at its head. When it uncoupled and went to run round the train, it found its way blocked by a MR engine while another blocked its retreat. [13]  The engine was shepherded to a nearby shed and the tracks were lifted. This episode became known as the \"Battle of Nottingham\" and, with the action moved to the courtroom, it was seven months before the locomotive was released. citation needed The Euston Square Confederacy edit The  London and Birmingham Railway  and its successor the  London and North Western Railway  had been under pressure from two directions. Firstly the Great Western Railway had been foiled in its attempt to enter Birmingham by the Midland, but it still had designs on Manchester. At the same time the LNWR was under threat from the GN's attempts to enter Manchester by the  Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway citation needed To London edit King's Cross 1857 \u2013 1868 edit An illustration of King's Cross from 1852, shortly before its use by the Midland Railway In 1850 the MR, though much more secure, was still a provincial line. Ellis realised that if it were to fend off its competitors it must expand outwards. The first step, in 1853, was to appoint  James Allport  as General Manager and the next was to shake off the dependence on the LNWR to  London Although a bill for a line from  Hitchin  into  King's Cross  jointly with the  GN , was passed in 1847 it had not been proceeded with.\n The bill was resubmitted in 1853 with the support of the people of Bedford, whose branch to the LNWR was slow and unreliable, and with the knowledge of the Northamptonshire iron deposits.\n The  Leicester and Hitchin Railway   ran from  Wigston  to  Market Harborough , through  Desborough Kettering Wellingborough  and  Bedford , then on the  Bedford to Hitchin Line , joining the GN at  Hitchin  for King's Cross. The line began its life in a proposition presented for the shareholders by George Hudson on 2 May 1842 as: \"To vest \u00a3600,000 in the South Midland Railway Company in their line from Wigston to Hitchin.\" citation needed   a full decade before realisation. The delay was partly due to the withdrawal of GN's interest in the competing scheme, the Bedford and Leicester Railway, after Midland purchased the Leicester and Swannington Railway and the Ashby Canal and Tramway, [14]  which were to have been the feeder lines. With the competition thwarted there was less rush to have this line as well as its branch lines to Huntingdon (from Kettering) and Northampton (from Bedford) finished. Both these branches were subsequently built by independent companies.\n While this took some of the pressure off the route through Rugby, the GNR insisted that passengers for London alight at Hitchin, buying tickets in the short time available, to catch a GNR train to finish their journey.  James Allport  arranged a seven-year deal with the  GN  to run into King's Cross for a guaranteed \u00a320,000 a year (equivalent to \u00a31,870,000 in 2018), [15] . Through services to London were introduced in February 1858. [16]  The construction of the Leicester and Hitchen railway cost \u00a31,750,000 [1]  (equivalent to \u00a3172,990,000 in 2018). [15] St. Pancras 1868 edit The Midland Hotel, St Pancras The interior of the Barlow train shed, circa 1870 By 1860 the MR was in a much better position and was able to approach new ventures aggressively. Its carriage of coal and iron \u2013 and beer from  Burton-on-Trent  \u2013 had increased by three times and passenger numbers were rising, as they were on the GN. Since GN trains took precedence on its own lines, MR passengers were becoming more and more delayed. Finally in 1862 the decision was taken for the MR to have its own terminus in the Capital, as befitted a national railway.\n On 22 June 1863, the Midland Railway (Extension to London) Bill was passed:\n \"An Act for the Construction by the Midland Railway Company of a new Line of Railway between London and Bedford, with Branches therefrom; and for other Purpose\". [17] The new line deviated at Bedford, through a gap in the  Chiltern Hills  at  Luton , reaching London by curving around  Hampstead Heath  to a point between King's Cross and Euston. The line from  Bedford  to  Moorgate  opened for passenger services on 13 July 1868 [18]  with services into  St Pancras station  starting on 1 October 1868. [19] St Pancras station  is a marvel of  Gothic Revival architecture , in the form of the  Midland Grand Hotel  by  Gilbert Scott , which faces  Euston Road , and the wrought-iron train shed designed by  William Barlow . Its construction was not simple, since it had to approach through the ancient  St Pancras Old Church  graveyard. Below was the Fleet Sewer, while a branch from the main line ran underground with a steep gradient beneath the station to join the  Metropolitan Railway , which ran parallel to what is now Euston Road. [20] The construction of the London Extension railway cost \u00a39,000,000 [1]  (equivalent to \u00a3795,400,000 in 2018). [15] To Manchester edit The  Victorians  had a way with words at  Rowsley Station Peak Rail The Grade II* listed  Manchester Central  train shed,  a northern terminus of the Midland Railway. From the 1820s proposals for lines from London and the East Midlands had been proposed, and they had considered using the  Cromford and High Peak Railway  to reach Manchester ( See Derby station citation needed Finally the MR joined with the  Manchester and Birmingham Railway  (M&BR), which was also looking for a route to London from Manchester, in a proposal for a line from  Ambergate . The  Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway , it received the Royal Assent in 1846, in spite of opposition from the  Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway . It was completed as far as  Rowsley  a few miles north of  Matlock  in 1849. However the M&BR had become part of the LNWR in 1846, thus instead of being a partner it had an interest in thwarting the Midland.\n In 1863 the MR reached Buxton, just as the LNWR arrived from the other direction by the  Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway . In 1867 the MR began an alternative line through Wirksworth (now the  Ecclesbourne Valley Railway ), to avoid the problem of the Ambergate line. The section from Wirksworth to Rowsley, which would have involved some tricky engineering, was not completed because the MR gained control of the original line in 1871, but access to Manchester was still blocked at Buxton. At length an agreement was made with the  Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR)  to share lines from a branch at  Millers Dale  and running almost alongside the LNWR, in what became known as the  Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee citation needed Continuing friction with the LNWR caused the MR to join the MS&LR and the GN in the  Cheshire Lines Committee , which also gave scope for wider expansion into Lancashire and Cheshire, and finally a new station at  Manchester Central [21] In the meantime Sheffield had at last gained a main-line station. Following representations by the council in 1867 the MR promised to build a through line within two years. To the MR's surprise, the Sheffield councillors then backed an improbable speculation called the Sheffield, Chesterfield, Bakewell, Ashbourne, Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway. This was unsurprisingly rejected by Parliament and the Midland built its \"New Road\" into a station at Pond Street. citation needed Among the last of the major lines built by the MR was a connection between Sheffield and Manchester, by a branch at  Dore  to  Chinley , opened in 1894 through the  Totley  and  Cowburn  Tunnels, now the  Hope Valley Line To Scotland edit The  Ribblehead Viaduct . Probably the most recognisable feature of the  Settle-Carlisle Railway In the 1870s a dispute with the  London and North Western Railway  (LNWR) over access rights to the LNWR line to Scotland caused the MR to construct the  Settle and Carlisle  line, [22]  the highest main line in England, to secure access to Scotland.\n The dispute with the LNWR was settled before the Settle and Carlisle was built, but  Parliament  refused to allow the MR to withdraw from the project. The MR was also under pressure from Scottish railway companies, which were eagerly awaiting the Midland traffic reaching Carlisle as it would allow them to challenge the  Caledonian Railway 's dominance on the West Coast traffic to Glasgow and Edinburgh. The  Glasgow and South Western Railway  had its own route from Carlisle to Glasgow via Dumfries and Kilmarnock, whilst the  North British Railway  had built the  Waverley Line  through the Scottish Borders from Carlisle to Edinburgh. The MR was obliged to go ahead and the Settle to Carlisle opened in 1876. [22] Later history edit Midland locomotive visiting the  North Norfolk Railway , once part of the M&GN, which the Midland part owned The  Nottingham and Melton Line  of the Midland Railway opened for goods traffic on 1 December 1879 [23]  and for passenger traffic on 1 March 1880. [24] By the middle of the decade investment had been paid for; passenger travel was increasing, with new comfortable trains; and the mainstay of the line \u2013 goods, particularly minerals \u2013 was increasing dramatically.\n Allport retired in 1880, to be succeeded by John Noble and then by George Turner. By the new century the quantity of goods, particularly coal, was clogging the network. The passenger service was acquiring a reputation for lateness. Lord Farrar reorganised the expresses, but by 1905 the whole system was so overloaded that no one was able to predict when many of the trains would reach their destinations. At this point Sir  Guy Granet  took over as General Manager. He introduced a centralised traffic control system, and the locomotive power classifications that became the model for those used by British Railways. citation needed The MR acquired other lines, including the  Belfast and Northern Counties Railway  in 1903 and the  London, Tilbury and Southend Railway  in 1912. It had running rights on some lines, and it developed lines in partnership with other railways, being involved in more 'Joint' lines than any other. In partnership with the GN it owned the  Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway  to provide connections from the Midlands to East Anglia, the UK's biggest joint railway. The MR provided motive power for the  Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway , and was a one-third partner in the  Cheshire Lines Committee In 1913 the company achieved a total revenue of \u00a315,129,136 (equivalent to \u00a31,462,280,000 in 2018) [15]  with working expenses of \u00a39,416,981 [25]  (equivalent to \u00a3910,180,000 in 2018).

Lines Jump to navigation Jump to search Farringdon station looking south-east. The Moorgate Line (formerly City Widened Lines) is the pair on the right, currently used by Thameslink. The  Widened Lines  (also known as the  City Widened Lines ; formerly known as the  Moorgate Line [1] [2] ) are a  double-track  railway line forming part of the  Thameslink Core Route  between  St Pancras  and  Farringdon  within central  London For most of their life the Widened Lines ran from  King's Cross  to  Moorgate , and were completed in 1866 when the  Metropolitan Railway  was widened from two to four tracks between King's Cross and Farringdon (hence the  widened  name) and a four-track railway opened from there to Moorgate.\n \nThe tracks were owned by the Metropolitan Railway but were used mainly by other railway companies. Connections to the  Great Northern Railway  (GNR) at King's Cross and  London, Chatham and Dover Railway  (LC&DR) at Farringdon allowed cross-London services to run. There was very soon a connection to the  Midland Railway  at St Pancras, near King's Cross. In the early 20th century competition led to the cross-London services being withdrawn, although the GNR and Midland services into Moorgate survived. The former GNR services were diverted via the  Northern City Line  to Moorgate in 1976, and in 1988 the cross-London route reopened for  Thameslink . The line east of Farringdon closed in 2009 to allow the platforms at Farringdon to be extended to take 12-car trains.

[4]  From Paddington the line was built using the \" cut-and-cover \" method beneath the  New Road , connecting the main line railway termini at  Paddington Euston  and  King's Cross , then followed  Farringdon Road  in tunnel and cutting to a station at Farringdon Street near  Smithfield , near the capital's financial heart in  the City . The service was initially provided by gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives.\n With connections to the  Great Western Railway  (GWR) and Great Northern Railway (GNR) under construction and connections to the Midland Railway and the LC&DR planned, the Met obtained permission in 1861 and 1864 [note 1]  for a four-track eastward extension to a new terminus at  Moorgate  and  two additional tracks from King's Cross to Farringdon Street. [5] [6] [7]  The Met used two tracks for its own services, the other two tracks being used mainly by other railway companies, and becoming known as the City Widened Lines. [8]  A pair of single track tunnels at King's Cross connecting the GNR to the Met came into passenger use on 1 October 1863 when the GNR began running trains, [9] [note 2]  those towards Farringdon Street calling at a single-platform station at  King's Cross  York Road, in the reverse direction at King's Cross Suburban station. [10]  A west curve towards Baker Street was built but not used for regular traffic and the track removed in 1865. Having withdrawn from running Metropolitan services on 10 August, the GWR returned on 1 October 1863 with through trains from such places as Windsor. [11] The extension to  Aldersgate Street  and  Moorgate Street  (now Barbican and Moorgate) opened on 23 December 1865, [12]  and all four lines were open on 1 March 1866. [13]  The parallel tracks from King's Cross to Farringdon, first used by GNR freight train on 27 January 1868, [14]  entered a second Clerkenwell tunnel before dropping at a gradient of 1 in 100, passing under the  Ray Street Gridiron  carrying the original Met track before ascending a 1 in 40 slope to Farringdon. [15]  A plan was developed to extend the City Widened Lines to Euston, but this was aborted and never completed.

[17]  From 3 January 1866 GNR services ran to Ludgate Hill and LC&DR services ran to Farringdon Street. [13] The Midland Railway junction opened on 13 July 1868 when services ran into Moorgate Street before St Pancras station opened. The line left the Midland main line at St Paul's Road Junction, entering a double-track tunnel and joining the Widened Lines at Midland Junction. A tunnel was built west of Midland Junction with the intent of quadrupling all the way to Paddington, but was not used until 1926. Initially services ran from the Tottenham & Hampstead Junction line to Moorgate and Victoria. From 1 July 1875 the Midland ran services from  Hendon  and  South Tottenham  to Victoria, the LC&DR between Victoria and Hendon. [18] On 1 September 1871 an eastern curve from the Snow Hill line was opened and the LC&DR diverted its Victoria to Farringdon service to Moorgate. This started at 80 trains per day, declining to 48 by 1913. [14] The  South Eastern Railway  (SER) built a connection with the LC&DR at Blackfriars Bridge. From 1 June 1878, the GNR ran six trains a day to  Woolwich Arsenal  and from 1 August 1880 the SER ran to Enfield and  Muswell Hill  on behalf of the GNR. [19] By the end of the 19th century a continental service was operating from  Liverpool  to  Paris , via the Widened Lines. Trains departed at 08:00 and arrived in Paris by 22:50 having travelled by paddle steamer access the  Channel  at  Folkestone [20] In the early 20th century competition from the electric underground railways and electric trams meant that the SER & GNR service was withdrawn on 30 April 1907, the GNR & LC&DR service in September 1907 and the Midland & LC&DR service in June 1908. [21]  Passenger services across London through  Snow Hill railway station  and Snow Hill tunnel were withdrawn in 1916. [22] From 1 January 1908 electric locomotives were exchanged for steam locomotives on passenger trains at Paddington, and GWR services continued to run until 1939. [14] On 28 July 1914 the  First World War  broke out, and on 5 August 1914 the City Widened Lines assumed major strategic importance as a link between the channel ports and the main lines to the north, being used for troop movements and freight. During the four years of war the line saw 26,047 military trains, which carried 250,000 long tons (254,000\u00a0t) of materials, [23]  but sharp curves prevented ambulance trains using this route. [24] The former GNR and Midland services continued to run to Moorgate,  DMUs  and diesel locomotives replacing steam in the 1960s. [25]  In 1976 the former GNR services were diverted at  Finsbury Park  via the  Northern City Line  to Moorgate, and York Road station and the curves into King's Cross closed. [26] In 1978 work started on electrification of the Widened Lines from St Pancras to Moorgate as part of the \"Bedpan\" line, an electric service between  Bedford  and Moorgate, opening on 15 July 1983. King's Cross Widened Lines station was renamed King's Cross Midland City, and  King's Cross Thameslink  in May 1988 when the Snow Hill tunnels reopened for  Thameslink [27] The line from Farringdon to Moorgate closed on 20 March 2009, to allow the platforms at Farringdon be extended to take 12-car trains. [25] LC&DR stations edit When the line opened south of Farringdon, the LC&DR had a station at  Ludgate Hill  that had opened on 1 June 1865 [28]  and  Blackfriars Bridge  on the south side of the Thames. [29]  On 2 March 1874  Holborn Viaduct  opened as a six-platform south-facing terminus. citation needed   Close by, Snow Hill opened on the through line on 1 August, renamed Holborn Viaduct Low Level in 1912. [22]  In 1886  Blackfriars railway station  opened, as St Paul's, on the north side of the river replacing Blackfriars Bridge, which closed the same year, renamed Blackfriars in 1937. [29]  When through traffic was withdrawn in 1916, Holborn Viaduct Low Level closed. Ludgate Hill closed in 1929. [28] After Thameslink services started, in 1990 Holborn Viaduct was replaced by new platforms on the through line, named St Paul's Thameslink (in 1991 renamed  City Thameslink [22] Goods and coal services edit Railway goods traffic developed in the 1860s and 1870s, by which time almost every station had an associated goods yard. It then became possible to send goods from any station (or siding) in Britain to any other station. In particular, any station in the South of England could receive goods from places in northern parts. Places in the South were also able to order coal from collieries in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire, as well as other coalfields, to be conveyed to destination by rail. Such traffic had to cross London from North to South. There was also a certain amount of traffic in the opposite direction, as well as returned empty coal wagons.\n The MR and GNR already having connections with the Widened Lines, it became convenient to use the route to transfer wagons of goods and coal to the Southern companies. By comparison, the LNWR and GWR used the route via the West London Railway, and the GER used the East London Railway. The method adopted was to run trains from the north to a place on the outskirts of London where there were sidings where the train could be broken up. The wagons destined for places south of the Thames were separated and made into a separate train to run across London to another group of sidings where they could be resorted according to final destination. Originally small groups of sidings were used, such as Kentish Town and West Hampstead on the MR, Holloway and Finsbury Park on the GNR. In the later part of the nineteenth century the amount of traffic outstripped the capacity of such places, and huge new marshalling yards were constructed at Brent Sidings MR and Ferme Park GNR.\n The companies south of the Thames received the cross-London traffic at places such as Battersea Wharf and Norwood Junction on the LB&SCR, Herne Hill on the LC&DR and Bricklayers Arms on the SER. Traffic from GNR to L&SWR used the Widened Lines to Clapham Junction or Brentford, or the North London and North & South Western Junction Railways, according to destination, but for traffic from MR to L&SWR the route via Acton Wells Junction and the North & South Western Junction Railway was more convenient, especially after the marshalling was done at Brent Sidings. The extensive marshalling yard at Hither Green SER was opened in 1899, while a new yard opened at Feltham on the L&SWR in 1917-21 largely replaced that company's existing yards.\n The overall picture was further complicated by the establishment of coal depots in South London by the \"northern\" companies, mainly the MR and GNR, which enabled them to take control of the whole transit of the coal from colliery to local distributor. These depots were served by dedicated workings from the yards on the MR and GNR - latterly Brent Sidings and Ferme Park \u2013 via the Widened Lines and running powers established at various dates. Further details can be found in an article by Edwin Course in  Railway Magazine [30] In 1877 there were 58 daily trips from the MR over the Widened Lines their own South London depots and to the LB&SCR, LC&DR and SER destinations mentioned above. [31]  There must have been a similar number of workings from the GNR, details of which can be found in the working timetables at the National Archives.\n Train loads were restricted through the tunnel section, and there was little scope for running longer and fewer trains. More paths were available for goods trains after the cessation of passenger services in 1916. Freight traffic continued and was of considerable importance in both World Wars. With the decline of wagonload freight traffic from the 1960s and the National Freight Train Plan of 1968, more use was made of the West London Line, allowing the Widened Lines to be abandoned for such traffic.\n Goods depots edit Goods depots opened near Farringdon on the Widened Lines. Smithfield Market Sidings opened 1 May 1869, serviced by the GWR. The GNR opened its depot on 2 November 1874, the Midland followed with its Whitecross depot on 1 January 1878. Finally the Met opened its depot at Vine Street in 1909, serviced by electric locomotives from West Hampstead [32]  The GNR goods depot closed on 15 January 1956 and Smithfield Market was last served by train on 28 July 1962. [32] Locomotives edit 19th century edit Almost from the date of opening of the Widened Lines, the various railway companies supplied their own  steam locomotives  (mostly fitted with  condensing apparatus ). These included: [33] Great Northern Railway Two  0-8-0 T locomotives from the  Avonside Engine Company , delivered in 1866 and numbered 472 and 473. These were designed for hauling coal trains to Farringdon Street and to South London via Snow Hill.  Six locomotives were ordered but the last four were cancelled because the first two proved ill-suited to the route because of their long rigid wheelbase. For passenger services, \"120 class\"  0-4-4 WT locomotives 621-628 (built 1872) were used. These had inconspicuous condensing apparatus with the pipework hidden from view.\n Great Western Railway For freight working, the GWR used  633 Class 0-6-0 T locomotives 643 and 644 built at  Wolverhampton railway works  in 1871-1872.  Four other members of the same class, 633, 634, 641 and 642, were used later.\n London Chatham and Dover Railway Four  2-4-0 T locomotives, built by the railway in 1872-1873 using boilers from  4-4-0s  that had been acquired in 1860-1861, were used. These rebuilds kept the names of the donor locomotives:  Aeolus Bacchus Vulcan  and  Comus . Later,  LCDR R class 0-4-4 T locomotives were used.\n London and North Western Railway Sixteen  Beyer Peacock 4-4-0 T locomotives, delivered 1871-1872 and numbered 2055-2070. These were to the same design as the  Metropolitan Railway A Class  but had weatherboards at the rear as well as the front.\n Midland Railway Six Beyer Peacock 4-4-0T locomotives delivered in 1868 and numbered 204-209. These were to the same design as the Metropolitan Railway A Class.\n 20th century edit During the 20th century, steam locomotives used on the Widened Lines included:\n GNR Class L1 0-8-2 T GNR Class N2 0-6-2 T GWR 9700 Class  0-6-0PT LMS Fowler 2-6-2T In the  diesel locomotive  era,  British Rail Class 23  (Baby Deltic) and  British Rail Class 31  locomotives were used on passenger trains between King's Cross and Moorgate.\n Notes and references edit Notes edit In the  Metropolitan Railway Act 1861  and the  Metropolitan Railway (Finsbury Circus Extension) Act 1861  and  Metropolitan Railway Act  was given Royal Assent on 25 July 1864 approving the additional tracks to King's Cross. One of these tunnels, completed in 1862, was used to bring GNR-loaned rolling stock to the Metropolitan Railway when the GWR withdrew its trains in August 1863.
